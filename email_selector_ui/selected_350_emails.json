October 1, 2025 In the face of recent abrupt shifts in federal funding for neuroscience research that supports consideration of the ethical, legal, and societal dimensions of neuroscience, including, for example, award terminations of National Institutes of Health research grant awards, we have developed a rapid response bridge funding opportunity for impacted work that aligns with our mission of advancing neuroscience in alignment with societal goals and human values. This rapid response bridge funding opportunity is for scholars, practitioners, and teams who are doing work that falls within the Dana Foundation\u2019s mission area of neuroscience and society and whose work has been put at risk due to changes in federal funding \u2013 including grant cancellations, reductions, and delays. While it is impossible for private philanthropy to close the gap left by federal funders, we can provide modest grants to mitigate some of the impact on scholars, projects, and project teams. These $25,000 grants are for activities to address immediate needs following grant cancellations, reductions, or delays, including: retaining and supporting trainees and skilled research staff completing key data collection analyzing already collected data thoughtful project closure with community partners maintaining interdisciplinary collaborations What does it mean to be \u2018doing work that falls within the Dana Foundation\u2019s mission area of neuroscience and society\u2019? Neuroscience and society is the interdisciplinary study of how neuroscience informs and reflects society, and practical work to put these ideas into action. Neuroscience and society includes fields where neuroscience interfaces with the world, such as ethics, law, humanities, medicine, arts, social sciences, policy, education, journalism, and public engagement. This list is meant to be illustrative, not exhaustive. Another way we think about it: Neuroscience & society is a paradigm for how we can teach neuroscience to people, train people to do societally relevant neuroscience-focused work, and engage diverse communities of people to shepherd the development and application of neuroscience. Visit our website to learn more about our programmatic goals and objectives. The Foundation does not fund purely empirical or conceptual biomedical and/or behavioral research projects without a substantive, active emphasis on addressing associated ethical, legal, and/or societal dimensions. For example, an interdisciplinary team working on an empirical neuroscience study would not constitute a responsive application, as the argument that all neuroscience research may ultimately benefit society is arguably true, but does not constitute sufficient alignment with our mission and programmatic priorities. More plainly: please do not submit an application if your work is solely focused on neuroscience research in the lab as this will not be eligible, costing you time to prepare your application and time for us to review your application and determine its ineligibility. Who is eligible to apply? To be eligible for these grants, applicants must: Be a PI on an award from a federal funding agency such as the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, the National Endowment for the Humanities, etc. Be negatively affected by changes in funding at that federal agency. Be doing work that falls within the Dana Foundation\u2019s mission area of neuroscience and society \u2013 see full explanation above. How to Apply We ask that applicants provide: The original funded proposal. Documentation of communication from the federal funding agency indicating that the award was terminated, rescinded, or reduced OR that spending is frozen OR that the anticipated yearly renewal of the award is delayed. A 2\u20133-page (no more than 1200 words) narrative memo describing how you would use the $25,000 and how the work aligns with the Dana Foundation\u2019s mission area of neuroscience and society (see full explanation above) and our values. A budget for a maximum of $25,000 (no indirect costs). We ask that applicants request only what they need within this limit, and to note if they have access to bridge funds at their university. Our goal is to support as many people as possible with our limited funds. Please send these materials to RapidResponse@dana.org with \u2018Rapid Response\u2019 in the subject line. Timeline and Logistics Applications must be received by Friday, October 10, 2025 (11:59 pm ET). A given PI/applicant may only apply once. Applications will be reviewed for eligibility. All eligible applications will be entered into a lottery, with awardees randomly selected until we reach the $300,000 total we have allocated for this opportunity. We expect to conduct the lottery on Thursday, November 6, 2025, with notifications of award sent promptly thereafter. Any questions can be directed to RapidResponse@dana.org.

He is the father of my dear friend Maurice Rosenbaum who is also one of the great leaders in our AgeTech community.\r\n\r\nMaurice and I met through our fathers, John and Joe, who had signed up for Vivo virtual strength training classes. It was the middle of the pando and I had traveled to Boca Raton to help my daughter move from there back to Atlanta. I logged into the class from my hotel room and the four of us had a great workout together.\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t get to know Joe well, but Maurice and I would become close friends and join forces to build a global community of innovators who redefining the experience of aging through technology.\r\n\r\nThe apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree, so if you know Maurice you also know quite a bit about Joe, even if you've never met him. First and foremost, Maurice is the kindest person I know. His face always lights up with a warm smile when he meets you, and he always wants to know how you\u2019re doing before talking business. He\u2019s the kind of guy that will share the highs and lows with you.\r\n\r\nIn his role as the founder and CEO of Boncrest he is always eager to meet with AgeTech founders and tries his best to help them. He offers thoughtful advice, is always a cheerleader, and often tests or pilots new innovations. He\u2019s never too busy to help.\r\n\r\nMaurice is a wonderful husband and father. He\u2019s always talking about his family and prioritizes them above all else. And he\u2019s a true friend. Maurice is always there for you.\r\n\r\nJoe, thank you for bringing Maurice and I together, and for raising a son who became such an exemplary man. The flame of your legacy burns brightly in him.\r\n\r\nJeff\r\n\r\nRead about the life of Joseph Howard Rosenbaum here: https://agetechatlanta.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=53adb10a42e57c428eca39254&id=b18eafa84e&e=0eeb6c8ba8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================================\r\nYou are receiving this email because you are a members of the AgeTech Atlanta community or opted in via our website.\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe gkreiman@gmail.com from this list:\r\nhttps://agetechatlanta.us11.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=53adb10a42e57c428eca39254&id=471cde4e16&t=b&e=0eeb6c8ba8&c=46f19e7833\r\n\r\nOur telephone:\r\n4045502224\r\n\r\nForward this email to a friend:\r\nhttps://us11.forward-to-friend.com/forward?u=53adb10a42e57c428eca39254&id=46f19e7833&e=0eeb6c8ba8\r\n\r\nUpdate your profile:\r\nhttps://agetechatlanta.us11.list-manage.com/profile?u=53adb10a42e57c428eca39254&id=471cde4e16&e=0eeb6c8ba8&c=46f19e7833",

Thank you for putting in that effort of\r\ncoming up with those use cases.\r\n\r\nFor each, I concretely thought what it would take to answer it correctly.\r\nFor each, there are two parts---(1) Data collection channel (zoom,\r\nin-person, email, etc.) and (2) What model will be needed to get the\r\nanswer. For each, I can confidently say what is to be done technologically.\r\nThis also gives me a sense of how difficult it will be.\r\n\r\nTreating you as \"User Zero\", the most useful next step would be to identify\r\nhow valuable each of these would be, if you were a user. Can you fill out\r\nthe *Value* column in the \"Gabriel's\" sheet?

The program is interested funding a supplement to one of the \r\nSTCs to design and implement a workshop on Center non-academic \r\npartnerships, with an emphasis on industry and foundations and other \r\nnon-profits. The general goal would be to discuss different STCs\u2019 and \r\npartners\u2019 perspectives and experiences, in order to share knowledge \r\namong the STCs (especially for the newer STCs) and with the STC program. \r\nGiven CBMM\u2019s experience with these types of partnerships, we thought the \r\nCenter would be well-suited for this effort.\r\n\r\nPhil Regalia said that CBMM is on a no-cost extension that ends on Aug \r\n31, and so the timeline on moving forward is short. Please let me know \r\nwhether you and/or others at CBMM are potentially interested. If so, I \r\ncan answer any questions and we can set up a time for a quick \r\nconversation. And if not, thank you for considering this, and we\u2019ll \r\nreach out to another Center.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nRebecca\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRebecca E.

This is a required meeting for all teams. As some of you remember from last time, you will have a timeslot, so you don\u2019t need to be there for the whole 2 hours. Each team will have 15 mins. to go through their milestones and provide an update to the Board.\r\nI will send out a form to fill out about your company update that serves as a pre-read for the Board so that they can come to the meeting prepared to make the most of the time they have with you. Keep an eye out for this and please complete it in a timely manner so I can get it to the Board a few days before we meet.\r\nHope everyone is having a great week!\r\nBest\r\nDK\r\n\r\n\r\n[Image]Debi Kleiman | The AI Lab for Startups | Digital Data Design Institute at Harvard<http://d3.harvard.edu/>  | HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\n---\n\n \n \n**![Image](cid:image001.png@01DB8920.732B2DD0)****Debi Kleiman**  | The AI Lab for Startups | [Digital Data Design Institute at Harvard](http://d3.harvard.edu/ \"https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fd3.harvard.edu%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cdkleiman%40hbs.edu%7Cfbfd861d6bd0485f30ba08dba7ea3711%7C09fd564ebf4243218f2db8e482f8635c%7C0%7C0%7C638288396600901245%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjA\")  | **HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL**\n---\nContent-Type:\timage/png; name=\"image001.png\"\nContent-Description:\timage001.png\nContent-Disposition:\tinline; filename=\"image001.png\"; size=1537;\n\t\tcreation-date=\"Thu, 27 Feb 2025 19:04:00 GMT\";\n\t\tmodification-date=\"Thu, 27 Feb 2025 19:04:00 GMT\"\nContent-ID:\t<image001.png@01DB8920.732B2DD0>\nContent-Transfer-Encoding:\tbase64",

You're receiving this \"almost every Sunday night\" email because you are a friend, stakeholder, or supporter of the AgeTech Connect movement. If you'd prefer not to receive future installments, send me a note and I'll remove you from the list.\r\n\r\nHere's what is on my mind tonight.\r\n\r\nA week ago, I hosted our fourth Senior Living and Post-Acute Care Innovation Summit in St. Petersburg, Florida. Leading executives in senior living and post-acute care attended this invitation-only event, along with researchers and educators from USF St. Pete. We always invite a small group of technology vendors to participate in an innovation showcase, so there were about 12 AgeTech startup founders there as well.\r\n\r\nThe program for the day's learning journey included keynotes, fireside chats, and panel discussions on a variety of topics, with technology as the central theme. One of the fireside chats was a conversation led by Lindsey Daugherty, Head of Community at Sage, and Esmerelda Lee, SVP of Operations at Discovery Senior Living. Discovery is now the second-largest senior living operator in the United States, with nearly four hundred communities.\r\n\r\nEsmerelda shared valuable insights on many topics, and I found her commentary on how Discovery has looked at vendor selection particularly interesting. Near the end of the session, Esmerelda agreed to field some questions from the audience, and I expected every startup founder to jump at the chance to engage with Esmerelda and ask a question. Much to my surprise, no one other than me raised a hand to ask a question. I was stunned to see these founders let a priceless opportunity like this slip away.\r\n\r\nRewind to a few weeks earlier. I had travelled to Louisville, where I co-presented the PrudentialPeak AgeTech Challenge Pitch competition at the new Thrive Center. Total Life, led by founder and CEO Neelam Brar, won the contest. Neelam is one of my favorite founders. She's smart, a fierce competitor, and works as hard as anyone I've ever met. And Total Life is a great success story in the making.\r\n\r\nAfter the pitch competition, our hosts treated us to a bourbon tasting and dinner at Angel's Envy Distillery. Between the cocktail hour and dinner, we listenend to a fireside chat with Char Hu, founder and CEO of the Helper Bees, and Missy Caple, Vice President, Medicare Product Development at Humana. At the end - you guessed it - Missy agreed to take a few questions. Neelam's hand immediately shot up, and she asked an intriguing question, which led to a follow-up conversation later in the evening.\r\n\r\nNeelam was focused, prepared, and she seized the opportunity.\r\n\r\nFounders, especially those struggling to find product-market fit, should be prepared to take advantage of an unplanned encounter with an A-list executive who can change the trajectory of their venture. They should always show up ready to ask a good question, and never let a chance to connect with an industry mogul slip away.\r\n\r\nSeize every opportunity, because you never know when you'll get another one.\r\n\r\nJeff\r\n\r\nPS - Shout out to the sponsors who made these two events possible: Prudential, Amba, Inspiren, Sage, The Thrive Center, CDW, OneStep, Faegre Drinker, Milliman\r\n\r\n\r\n==============================================\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe gkreiman@gmail.com from this list:\r\nhttps://agetechatlanta.us11.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=53adb10a42e57c428eca39254&id=471cde4e16&t=b&e=0eeb6c8ba8&c=1ab43fe220\r\n\r\n\r\nForward this email to a friend:\r\nhttps://us11.forward-to-friend.com/forward?u=53adb10a42e57c428eca39254&id=1ab43fe220&e=0eeb6c8ba8\r\n\r\nUpdate your profile:\r\nhttps://agetechatlanta.us11.list-manage.com/profile?u=53adb10a42e57c428eca39254&id=471cde4e16&e=0eeb6c8ba8&c=1ab43fe220",

The successful launch of this program has been a thrilling journey filled with important lessons in bolstering entrepreneurship in academic settings - our initial cohort of founders, mentors, and board members were absolutely critical to the success.  As we move forward with growing the broader D^3 research institute, we have a heightened focus on our core competency of producing academically rigorous research.  We have decided to lean into these skills and increase our efforts on researching how AI is reshaping the entrepreneurial journey among global startups, providing the world with a better understanding of AI's role in scaling, strategy, and innovation.\r\n\r\nIn parallel, the <https://www.iq.harvard.edu/> Institute for Quantitative Social Science<https://www.iq.harvard.edu/> (IQSS) has been working on launching a social science commercialization initiative. IQSS believes that there's an opportunity to advance the social sciences through commercialization and startup creation, both for the purpose of amplifying the scholarly work of the social sciences and to empower this scholarship with access to new data, people, platforms, knowledge, and other resources. IQSS is uniquely suited to tap into new innovations in the quantitative social sciences to use these developments to commercialize existing work and to simultaneously advance the goals of social science faculty, postdocs, and students across the University.\r\n\r\nHBS and IQSS have collaborated closely since the early days of D^3 and the Foundry. IQSS was instrumental to the original incubation and ultimately founding of D^3, and has been involved throughout the whole history of the Startup Foundry. IQSS has been participating in the ongoing Advisory Board and together we created a resource sharing partnership to offer founders fractional Chief Product Officer consulting through IQSS. Earlier this year, IQSS began scoping and exploring a co-branded, formal sponsorship of the AI Lab for Startups to recognize and expand the collaboration. We are excited to tell you that we are all aligned on IQSS as the new home for the AI Lab for Startups programmatic mission, while D^3 focuses on its research mission.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the common interest throughout our community in this move to IQSS from all stakeholders, including our donors, the leadership of D^3, IQSS, HBS, FAS, and the whole university.  We look forward to building on the success and momentum we have seen over the last two years and hope to take this to the next level. We plan to elevate the AI Lab for Startups to a university-wide academic entrepreneurship program, and to bring the work of startup formation closer to the academic/research community that is generating the technology, ideas, and new founders. Additionally, it will enable connecting with IQSS' broader industry-academic partnership goals for the benefit of social science research through incentive compatible collaboration. IQSS looks forward to continuing to foster the progress of the AI Lab for Startups and its goals, working with the stellar founders, researchers, and partners who have been part of this journey so far.\r\n\r\nThis transition will be effective as of Monday, March 24th. We anticipate a smooth transition with no interruption to the program. We (Gary and Elizabeth) look forward to engaging with you in the coming weeks in our redesign of the expanded program.\r\n\r\nWe are very grateful to this program's committed, enthusiastic and generous donor and the establishment of the \"Kelly and Carla Kimball Fund for Entrepreneurship at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences\". We also would like to thank Debi Kleiman for her ongoing leadership and stewardship of the program.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nJen Stave, Launch Director, Digital Data Design (D^3) Institute\r\n\r\nKarim Lakhani, Dorothy & Michael Hintze Professor of Business Administration and Chair, D^3 Institute\r\n\r\nGary King, Albert J.

Thank you very much for the productive and fun meeting, as well as your valuable time.\r\n\r\nI just remembered one of my favorite books (Funes el memorioso / Funes the memorious) of all times by one of my favorite authors, Jorge Luis Borges. I do not know if you were inspired by it to baptize your company, if you did, it is awesome:)\r\n\r\nExciting and impactful journey. Let me digest this information and talk to Yigit. And please keep us posted about the developments of your round, including the valuation, if the feeling is mutual. In the meantime, if you have a data room, or any additional documents we can see, we would appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI have homework:\r\n\r\n  *   Introduce Meditopia, and Huckleberry Labs to share experiences. Fatih of Meditopia is done. I already asked Jessica, the CEO of Huckleberry.\r\n  *   Introduce Incubate if Kazuki-san (Notsu) is interested in acting rapidly.\r\n  *   Introduce any potential design partners (non-regulated industries with non-sensible data).\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nHave a great weekend,\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nFuat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Jun 4, 2025 at 3:48\u202fAM Yigit Ihlamur <yigit@vela.partners> wrote:\r\nHola Gabriel,\r\n\r\nIt was an honor and pleasure to meet you yesterday.

Phenotypic optimization for one role is in opposition to optimization for the other. Consequently, most lineages manifest compromise phenotypes that function adequately in both roles. However, snake tongues have abandoned feeding function completely and become specialized for collecting volatile odor molecules from the air. Chameleon tongues, in contrast, have virtually lost chemosensory function and become specialized projectile organs capable of grasping prey with an intrinsically mobile tongue tip. I focus on the former, touching on the latter if there is time. We have known for a century that tongue-flicking (TF) in squamates collects environmental chemicals (odorants) and delivers them to tiny openings in the palate leading to paired vomeronasal organs, a secondary olfactory sense distinct from nasal olfaction. Lizard TFs consist of a single, protraction-up-down-retraction cycle with the tongue tips nearly always contacting the substrate. Snake tongue-flicks, in contrast, consist of multiple, sequential, high velocity tongue cycles (oscillatory tongue-flicking/OTF), many of which are aerial. Nevertheless, our understanding of the functional significance for TF in both is the same. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) of airflow around the tongue tips during OTF in garter snakes revealed that snakes generate two pairs of standing, counter-rotating, vortices that draw fresh air in from the sides, accelerating it vertically into the paths of the moving tongue tips. We hypothesize that rapid OTF and the organized advection system it creates serve to mitigate diffusive constraints on the rate of molecular mass transfer onto the tongue tips by means of boundary layer reduction and maintenance of a concentration gradient. It is also likely that OTF serves to integrate the chemical signal in patchy odor plumes temporally and spatially on each tine of the forked tongue, possibly providing directional information.\r\n\r\n[image.png][image.png]\r\n\r\nBio: Kurt Schwenk is a functional morphologist and evolutionary biologist in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut. He received a BA from Oberlin College in 1977 and then worked as a zookeeper at the Bronx Zoo in New York City before completing his Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1984. Dr. Schwenk\u2019s research focuses on the anatomy, function, biomechanics, and evolution of feeding and chemosensory systems in terrestrial vertebrates, especially lizards and snakes. He uses his empirical work to address broader questions about phenotypic evolution, with a particular interest in the concept of evolutionary constraint. His work relies on the integration of data from gross anatomy, histology, photography, and high-speed macro-videography.\r\n\r\nHosted by the Soft Math Lab<https://softmath.seas.harvard.edu/>.

Our team plans to study dog vocalizations in naturalistic settings using Artificial Intelligence (AI), collecting visual and audio recordings to better understand how dogs communicate.\r\nWe are planning to apply for a research grant next year (e.g., AI for Science / CRP) to support this work and are very interested in a research collaboration with you. We would love to arrange a short meeting and on-site visit to discuss whether it\u2019s possible to collect recordings at your facility in a non-intrusive, welfare-friendly way.\r\nWe would acknowledge your support in publications and share research insights that may benefit your work with dogs.\r\nPlease let us know if you are open to research collaborations. Thank you for your time, and we look forward to your reply.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMengmi\r\nNanyang assistant professor and PI of Deep NeuroCognition Lab\r\nCollege of Computing and Data Science\r\nNanyang Technological University\r\nLab website: https://a0091624.wixsite.com/deepneurocognition-1\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY: This email is intended solely for the person(s) named and may be confidential and/or privileged.

My sense from the SEAS staff is that my presentation will be better received if there are one or two people in the audience who are also affiliated with the AEN.  I have been keeping abreast of what's going on at Harvard, and my talk is definitely a step in the right direction.  If any of you are able to join me, I would be most grateful, and my hosts will have all the more reason to suggest bringing the AEN to speak at other schools on campus.

An opportunity to show up for AEN and our mission to fight antisemitism on Harvard\u2019s campus. Next month our Administrator Engagement consultant, Dr. Nancy Koppelman, is leading a session for the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences \u201cJewish Identity and Antisemitism on Campus.\u201d This program is on 2/25, we are still confirming the time but we think it\u2019s 1:00-3:00.\n\n\n\nNancy\u2019s hosts at Harvard SEAS have explicitly told us that they want AEN members to attend the program. I would like to secure a volunteer to speak with Nancy ahead of the program and to get RSVPs from whomever is available to attend.\n\n\n\nPlease be in touch as soon as you can.\n\n\n\nThank you so much!\n\nSarah\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[cid:ii_194b88c25724cff311]\n\n\nSarah Livingston, MA\nDirector of Member Engagement\n\nAcademic Engagement Network\nCell: (614) 440-4860\nEmail: sarah@academicengagement.org<mailto:sarah@academicengagement.org>\n\n\n\nSchedule a call with me on Calendly!<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://secure-web.cisco.com/15uzVxa2dTmlJa0ChO-Eozt1pOPyMHaFNWfqJB9yBSh2aGtYpPquB74W2OIrnadeN3GHAAj-xTsc715SoM51fn3tIjBACTX40mBgww5yn9t0Nx1_WoPaoRUrDWDDAcQwVVOwGkfugy_NFUDepN8XtbIWJ1zySzMu6ty-09tGHW07cWSNsaDv39a-BH_FO1dIAgGrlUjCOQmwcyKcVgOo-TxBZnm6mKbIhorwj-0kFDzNX-GB5FKhh-rJVhaueQbS9XgFAK4rTwBhqOjIGVWjbqUM6n1upnMOxVvOWb-zXMCyoDa7Zcrc0cJ9_ILekImqjAbEFCQAEXEUL9K6dm39JyQ/https*3A*2F*2Fcalendly.com*2Fsarah-academicengagement__;JSUlJQ!!NZvER7FxgEiBAiR_!qEN3VcoqlV-CORLnI1BJMIK-5V0ZiuhBBuUWHdReA8Og4mFCJcbsFRKfifSLeh0QAvnkf2AvCeqaB2zo9ORbPqn0YUp8tAtMJQ$>\n\n\n\nConnect with me:\n\nLinkedIn<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://secure-web.cisco.com/1DhPTCnOq90CZuzuD5bMPI-pHjpScbvoeNN3ilRsz2MjaUr2PwWtbKOXKtYB8RnBdRi0hxyngjoKxFb0nOwv0kGSLQ_7J_jY_WN41ojticph-BbSYuf1RrR5NWpzO8hClWSFJDkUrOVgknrv9-39uCiVlkSEQdkGAtuazo4sXVPi92zyq6kSG7PAfSFL8usJZsN7HgCFdDfjvAok4Ze0kq5OW_iVD5TJZU_-R3z--pR8uHnVUidyELymodi2mnUic-JX-PSIw788uuNcuKXtqlqXxaeYOCVMrILt5q3wFyv74wExOS_XmUmgq8RNAC74pLeYt7ZU4gswXKVO6t6YOzA/https*3A*2F*2Fwww.linkedin.com*2Fin*2Fsarahlivingston3d*2F__;JSUlJSUl!!NZvER7FxgEiBAiR_!qEN3VcoqlV-CORLnI1BJMIK-5V0ZiuhBBuUWHdReA8Og4mFCJcbsFRKfifSLeh0QAvnkf2AvCeqaB2zo9ORbPqn0YUpkVgE-1g$>  |  Facebook<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://secure-web.cisco.com/1OD7b2Fd9tQbZH_aaF-PY0SSRu3BCb-WHbXQurHKQjsjxtauTohtvUmpZK7KU-UVUQ1j8HJDVTNDDv0FOBqEQJRHaKYlEmHZE8vlxXaJuHPGQMbbKDmhrzrdpxXR7GbJa9uGumtBDo_K8OLp7pirYhirsbmJgGedCTNEdYolVIlICtvxWxV4539IzLyIlywCgZZzLrlDuDHM_RwCGuBcFz2Xe2iKdK6Wq4ha8Evmo_H6xeGfxYqBH4UU4qrqbNWg3Dml9yLt2_JEBjCvOnlCn0a8lzaJSfnv-2i2fOqoE8ZGryNOgDbKfjUlvh9jG1Bh1RQXMlOrtfwG_nS-hePeG4g/https*3A*2F*2Fwww.facebook.com*2Fsarah.livingston.0524*2F__;JSUlJSU!!NZvER7FxgEiBAiR_!qEN3VcoqlV-CORLnI1BJMIK-5V0ZiuhBBuUWHdReA8Og4mFCJcbsFRKfifSLeh0QAvnkf2AvCeqaB2zo9ORbPqn0YUrhiNRD7Q$>  |  Instagram<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://secure-web.cisco.com/17dMeTEyBPbH81O1rquiYeZA7Ct0OS4zw0D8M1SZmb_1FI0fmGhDHBNO-5Zbnjjckq2yBeUiosqyFvfEk5NJRYDNInsN2Gq4Zecl0MZYRBhpiqN1YIO7lyuef7DjFs1dAZpaF1urdr7_ngJKkPGV1zSO1BwEgUivbFsp83guV0zppM5dWIGl9_8_3juRb1SvAMeBKRUyI7VOUGuMvA0peCOZZGhcuMFygB9rdqirD9BohDwuXCzHDf3ws87I6o-N94R6t-ZVzntauVHIXfYKTjL60GmqAH3Q6xrT7FnJ__UNdxcja_GZF1QXmcU3My_QD4gl9iN7gziZx8gmM6rYj-A/https*3A*2F*2Fwww.instagram.com*2Fimaof2boys*2F__;JSUlJSU!!NZvER7FxgEiBAiR_!qEN3VcoqlV-CORLnI1BJMIK-5V0ZiuhBBuUWHdReA8Og4mFCJcbsFRKfifSLeh0QAvnkf2AvCeqaB2zo9ORbPqn0YUpcxBJ9zw$>\n\n\n\nThe information transmitted in this electronic communication is intended only for the person or entity to whom it is addressed.

In vision --- the dominant primate sense --- this makes us blind to our own blindness, leading us astray in asking theoretical questions. Centuries of work, including contributions from Kepler through Newton to Maxwell, laid foundation for understanding retina, mainly as an optical sampling device of the environment. Then, within just a decade (1950s - 60s), electrophysiological recordings leapt from retinal neurons to those in primary visual cortex (V1), revealing how optical signals are transformed to signals in individual neurons. Yet progress beyond V1 has been markedly slower than the leap from retina to V1.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is vision as it advances from retina to mind?   A suitable formulation must recognize the brain's information processing (attentional) bottleneck, which admits a tiny fraction of retinal visual input for deeper processing. A fresh formulation (Zhaoping 2014, 2019) posits vision as looking and seeing: looking --- mainly by shifting gaze --- selects information for entry into the bottleneck, while seeing recognizes or infers object properties from what is selected. Since we are blind to non-selected inputs, understanding looking --- which often occurs before and even without seeing --- is essential to understanding vision as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis formulation generates falsifiable predictions, tested experimentally in psychology and neuroscience. Discoveries include a functional role of V1 in exogenously guiding gaze shifts, the involvement of neural circuits within and beyond V1, and new visual illusions in the process of seeing (Zhaoping 2025). These advances yield uncanny insights into our vision and mind. This framework can be extended to understand senses and minds of other animal species, e.g.,  rodents, fish, birds, bats, insects, many dominantly use a non-visual sense to \"see\" their world (Zhaoping 2023).\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nZhaoping, L.

In lieu of the planned lecture, Josh has\r\n   suggested that we watch his keynote lecture from the Cogsci 2025\r\n   conference, followed by Q&A over zoom. The theme of the talk in his words\r\n   is \"the present moment in which AI and Cog Sci are connecting, and how\r\n   these two fields can best interact in building better theories of human\r\n   cognition\"\r\n   - We will set up the video of Josh's Cogsci lecture in Lillie at 1:30pm,\r\n   for anyone who would like to optionally watch it together. You can also\r\n   watch the talk separately if you like, at this link\r\n   <https://us06web.zoom.us/rec/play/_aUf_dKjOQwdu42ox_6BY424QFruGmFjTUTozMpHq9in6SwuLR20M3HFmksezEVUoum9Ve-askp0_2Y.GVjtD_2RJhs9A_W5?eagerLoadZvaPages=sidemenu.billing.plan_management&accessLevel=meeting&canPlayFromShare=true&from=share_recording_detail&continueMode=true&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fus06web.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FFsflbLDMuWBj9oLumQ6fRGOJTlBFlAvW4alIRocmch9OS6xu8v4bTRbhaxzf7zLx.G0OhjeMXUxjgjRqM>\r\n   (it is a whole-day video, Josh's talk starts at 03:16:55)\r\n   - Josh will join us via Zoom for Q&A from 3pm-4:15pm today (in Lillie\r\n   Auditorium). He says he is happy to take questions about the talk or\r\n   anything else anyone wants to talk about - and he also has some slides that\r\n   relate the content of his talk to the brain, if folks are interested.\r\n\r\nSam Gershman's lecture will proceed afterwards at 4:30pm, as planned.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMorgan\r\n-- \r\n*Morgan B.

I am attaching all the files you\r\nwill need.\r\n\r\nThe file benchmarking.ipynb will set you up to access all the combined\r\ninformation i.e. what we called All of D in our call today. You can ignore\r\ncombining_raw_data.ipynb, I already combined all D together for your\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nprocessed_data_K contains what we have.\r\n\r\nIdeally, what we would want to do:\r\n\r\nGo over all the questions in the\r\nfile gabriel_qa_extended_w_meetings_and_emails.csv and generate an answer\r\nfor it from OpenAI/Gemini/ etc.\r\n\r\nFor OpenAI I think you will have to do some chunking etc as the context is\r\ntoo large for it.\r\n\r\nThe results will ultimately be filled out here:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mhzl1YXDSSPT-ZIt_Y9rvb38o2i0qJWjlhtrfogSjV8/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n\r\nI am attaching PDF of the call notes too. Let's meet this\r\nThursday/Friday---can you please pick a time on my calendly? Of course,\r\nfeel free to book an earlier time if something is unclear.\r\n\r\nExciting stuff!

Our team plans to study dog vocalizations in naturalistic settings using Artificial Intelligence (AI), collecting visual and audio recordings to better understand how dogs communicate.\r\nWe are planning to apply for a research grant next year (e.g., AI for Science / CRP) to support this work and are very interested in a research collaboration with you. We would love to arrange a short meeting and on-site visit to discuss whether it\u2019s possible to collect recordings at your facility in a non-intrusive, welfare-friendly way.\r\nWe would acknowledge your support in publications and share research insights that may benefit your work with dogs.\r\nPlease let us know if you are open to research collaborations. Thank you for your time, and we look forward to your reply.\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMengmi\r\nNanyang assistant professor and PI of Deep NeuroCognition Lab\r\nCollege of Computing and Data Science\r\nNanyang Technological University\r\nLab website: https://a0091624.wixsite.com/deepneurocognition-1\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY: This email is intended solely for the person(s) named and may be confidential and/or privileged.

We're thrilled to have you join us and look forward to supporting your venture through our resources, mentorship, and community of fellow academic founders.\r\n\r\nLet me outline our key program components:\r\n\r\nProgramming, Mentors & Updates\r\n- We host monthly/bi-monthly Zoom sessions covering essential entrepreneurial topics with expert speakers (highly recommended, though not mandatory)\r\n- Each quarter, you'll set and work toward 3 specific milestones. Quarterly presentations to our Innovation Committee, where you'll share progress on your milestones, are required to maintain your spot in the program.\r\n- Within the next week, I'll connect you with your Core Mentor, who will meet with you at least twice monthly (frequency can be adjusted based on your needs).\r\n\r\n\r\nNext Steps\r\n1. Please send me:\r\n   - Your latest executive summary or pitch deck\r\n   - A brief pitch (2-3 sentences)\r\n   - Short bios for team members\r\n\r\n2. I'll begin scheduling our regular sessions. Could you confirm if both team members will be participating fully? Also, please let me know if I may share your contact information with our mentors.\r\n\r\n3.

PhD student in Leyla Isik\u2019s group at Hopkins. Kathy\u2019s research centers on understanding how the brain extracts information from sequences of dynamical visual input and how to implement her findings in computer vision algorithms. Kathy has several publications and has experience in both academic research and industry applications as a data scientist. She is a first-generation indigenous Guatemalan to graduate college, while also providing financial support for her family.\r\nRobert (Max) Dabagia (Module 2). PhD student in Santosh Vempala\u2019s group at Georgia Tech planning to start a postdoc with Christos Papadimitriou later this year. Max has been responsible for the latest developments in the mathematical model of the brain, NEMO, enabling it to learn algorithms or exhibit attention and solve analogy tasks.\r\nRoman Beliy (Module 3). PhD student in Math and Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute. As a graduate student, Roman pioneered the development of contemporary analysis techniques using machine learning to decode images from fMRI signals. His NeurIPs papers are highly cited. Per his PhD advisor, Roman is the driving force of the most exciting developments in the lab contributing novel ideas and implementing them into code. He has done a lot of this work despite dealing with challenging personal circumstances including the death of his mother.\r\nYan Zhuang (Modules 3-4). Yan is finishing a masters degree with Tianmin Shu at Hopkins and will start his PhD with Yen-Ling Kuo at UVA in Computer Science in the Fall. During his masters program, Yan has worked as a developer of a state-of-the-art outdoor world simulator for multi-agent interactions. He has been the leader of this effort coordinating the work between labs at Hopkins and UCSD. At UVA, Yan will work on Markov Decision Processes in robotic settings to enable robot-human interactions. The work he did in his masters demonstrates he works well in a fast-paced environments.\r\n\r\n\n---\n\n\nMessage 2\nFrom: Gabriel Kreiman <gkreiman@gmail.com>\nTo: Hector Luis Penagos-Vargas <penagos@mit.edu>\nTime: 2025-04-14T10:35:34-04:00\nSubject: Re: Top candidates for BMM 2025\n\nThank you!\r\n\r\nOn Sun, Apr 13, 2025 at 6:29\u202fPM Hector Luis Penagos-Vargas <penagos@mit.edu>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Hi Gabriel,\r\n[...]\n>\r\n>\r\n\r\n-- \r\nGabriel Kreiman\r\ngkreiman@gmail.com\r\nhttp://klab.tch.harvard.edu\r\n\n---\nThank you! \n  \n\nOn Sun, Apr 13, 2025 at 6:29 PM Hector Luis Penagos-Vargas <[penagos@mit.edu](mailto:penagos@mit.edu)> wrote:  \n[...]\n>   \n> \n  \n\n  \n\n\\--   \n\nGabriel Kreiman  \n[gkreiman@gmail.com](mailto:gkreiman@gmail.com)\n<http://klab.tch.harvard.edu>",

Actually, I was sternly told I should not be asking about specific reviewers (I wasn't), and reassured that conflicts were checked.  I was *not* told that they had verified that there were no conflicts.\r\n\r\nI asked ChatGPT to review the writing style of each critique and assess which member of the roster was the most likely to have written it.  This is what it came up with:\r\n\r\n> Summary of Hypotheses\r\n> \r\n>     Critique 1: Gianfranco Doretto, PhD\r\n>     Critique 2: Ava K. Bittner, OD, PhD\r\n>     Critique 3: Sonia Chernova, PhD\r\n>     Critique 4: Alexandra Rae Bowers, PhD\r\n> \r\n> This attribution is based on the critique's content and tone, aligned with panel member expertise and research focus. Direct > confirmation would require access to confidential review assignments.\r\n\r\nSo, although your suspicions on Alex may have been right, oddly not for Critique 3.  I tried re-reading the full review again, but it just made me angry.  I'd like to have a meeting with my PO, Cheri Wiggs, but I'm not sure what to say to her other than the reviewers were out of line.\r\n\r\n- J.\r\n\r\n--\r\nJohn S.

But it would be extremely difficult to\r\nexplain one of the reviewer's comments unless it was from Alex Bowers (see\r\nmy previous emails, they cited an unpublished random conference abstract\r\nfrom Alex Bowers, etc., etc., etc.). I was rather surprised about her\r\nextreme negative tone. I know Alex Bowers. I have not interacted a lot with\r\nher, but I would not imagine any special animosity on her side. Of course,\r\nsometimes we are rather oblivious to people who have strong feelings\r\nagainst us. And the scientific comments from her were largely irrelevant.\r\nBut regardless of such feelings, I am technically in the same HMS\r\ndepartment as Alex Bowers. Of course, NIH always checks COIs but they rely\r\nstrongly on the PIs self-identifying those COIs. I cannot imagine how or\r\nwhy Alex Bowers would not indicate a COI (I would definitely not review\r\npapers or grants from her).\r\nBut again, even if we exclude this reviewer, there were other negative\r\nreviews.\r\n\r\nCheri is great and helped us a lot with her feedback in the past. I have no\r\nidea what can be done at this stage. I actually thought that we have a\r\ngreat idea/product/proposal (though it is true that we wrote everything in\r\na rush). If I can help in any way, let me know. A lot of the comments are\r\nvery easy to address and change. But unless there is a new call for this\r\nproposal and unless you are willing and able to submit a revised version\r\nand unless we can wait for another cycle, I have no clue what could be\r\ndone. Perhaps I do not have enough imagination or understand what NIH\r\nprogram officers can or cannot do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Jan 16, 2025 at 11:21\u202fAM Pezaris, John <Pezaris.John@mgh.harvard.edu>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Hi Gabriel,\r\n[...]\n\r\n-- \r\nGabriel Kreiman\r\ngkreiman@gmail.com\r\nhttp://klab.tch.harvard.edu\r\n\n---\nOn Thu, Jan 16, 2025 at 11:21 AM Pezaris, John <[Pezaris.John@mgh.harvard.edu](mailto:Pezaris.John@mgh.harvard.edu)> wrote:  \n[...]\n>  \\- J.  \n>    \n>  \\--  \n>  John S.

Thank you again for your early feedback on our venture\r\nlast year. As promised, I\u2019d like to introduce my co-founder, Prof. Gabriel\r\nKreiman\u2014a Harvard Medical School professor with 30+ years in AI and human\r\nmemory. *He is shutting down his tenured lab at Harvard to lead\r\nMemorious **full-time.\r\n*Our vision is to create *superhumans* by endowing humanity with perfect,\r\ninfinite memory.\r\n\r\nOur slide deck is attached. We would love to share more over a call if\r\nthere is interest. We met several VCs in Palo Alto this week, and multiple\r\nfunds are committed. Anant Vidur Puri spoke very highly of you, so we\r\nwanted to see if you\u2019d be interested as we close our round in the next two\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n*A blurb about our venture:*\r\n\r\n\r\n*Memorious* is your personal memory companion designed to augment human\r\nmemory using AI. Everything you read, every person you meet, and every\r\nconversation you have\u2014all *instantly accessible without any search or\r\nprompts*. Using Ambient Intelligence, we spontaneously surface your\r\nmemories exactly when you need them. Superhuman memory, powered by AI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur privacy-first technology outperforms standard AI: *92% accuracy vs 43%\r\nfor LLMs like OpenAI* and *2X faster recall speeds*. In the $3B+ brain\r\ntraining and wellness app market, we're reimagining human memory with AI to\r\ngive everyone perfect, infinite recall.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Leadership:* Dr. Gabriel Kreiman, Harvard Medical School Professor\r\nspecializing in AI and human memory, and Dr. Spandan Madan, Harvard AI\r\nresearcher with a decade of deep-learning systems experience.

If we do NOT hear back from you, we will assume you do not want to participate as a respondent in the survey this year.\r\n\r\nIf you do agree to participate, your responses, in combination with responses from other global survey participants, will help to determine the next iteration of the QS World University rankings (including at the global, regional, subject and programme levels, where relevant) and will specifically inform the Academic Reputation Index<https://support.qs.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4405952675346-Academic-Reputation>.\r\n\r\nPlease note:\r\n\r\n  *   QSIU will email you the survey request from the email address rankings@qs.com<mailto:rankings@qs.com>. QSIU typically sends one invitation, along with a maximum of two reminders. We recommend adding rankings@qs.com<mailto:rankings@qs.com> as a safe sender to avoid having the email identified as spam.\r\n  *   Surveys are typically distributed in the first quarter each year, so we recommend looking out for emails from QSIU in February or March.\r\n  *   All survey data will be used in aggregate form.\r\n  *   You will not be contacted by QSIU for more than two editions of their survey.\r\n  *   QSIU will not contact you for any other reason without supplementary or separate consent.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your collaboration and partnership with TAU, and wishing you a happy 2025!\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n[A group of black circles with white text  Description automatically generated]\r\nProfessor Milette Shamir\r\nVice President, International\r\nTel Aviv University\r\np: +972(03)640-5224 m: +972-54-7670775\r\na: Minhala Building 304, Tel Aviv, Israel 6997801\r\nw: https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/mshamir\r\n\r\n\r\n\n---\n_If you consent to us sending along your information to QSIU, could you let us know by January_ _20_ _th_ ___?

I\u2019d like to\r\nintroduce my co-founder, Prof. Gabriel Kreiman\u2014a Harvard Medical School\r\nprofessor with 30+ years in AI and human memory. *He is shutting down his\r\ntenured lab at Harvard to lead Memorious **full-time. *Our vision is to\r\ncreate *superhumans* by endowing humanity with perfect, infinite memory.\r\n\r\nOur slide deck is attached. We met several VCs in Palo Alto this week, and\r\nmultiple funds are committed. We plan on closing the funding round in the\r\nnext 2 weeks, so any warm introductions to relevant VCs in your network\r\nwould be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n*A blurb about our venture:*\r\n\r\n*Memorious* is your personal memory companion designed to augment human\r\nmemory using AI. Everything you read, every person you meet, and every\r\nconversation you have\u2014all *instantly accessible without any search or\r\nprompts*. Using Ambient Intelligence, we spontaneously surface your\r\nmemories exactly when you need them. Superhuman memory, powered by AI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur privacy-first technology outperforms standard AI: *92% accuracy vs 43%\r\nfor LLMs like OpenAI* and *2X faster recall speeds*. In the $3B+ brain\r\ntraining and wellness app market, we're reimagining human memory with AI to\r\ngive everyone perfect, infinite recall.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Leadership:* Dr. Gabriel Kreiman, Harvard Medical School Professor\r\nspecializing in AI and human memory, and Dr. Spandan Madan, Harvard AI\r\nresearcher with a decade of deep-learning systems experience. Our advisory\r\nboard includes Tom Gruber (Co-Founder and CTO, Siri Inc.) and Hanlin\r\nTang (Co-Founder\r\nand CTO, MosaicML).\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nSpandan\r\n\n---\n\n---\nContent-Type:\tapplication/pdf; name=\"Memorious Deck.pdf\"\nContent-Disposition:\tattachment; filename=\"Memorious Deck.pdf\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding:\tbase64\nContent-ID:\t<f_mbfb5kei0>\nX-Attachment-Id:\tf_mbfb5kei0\n\n\nMessage 2\nFrom: Dimi Kellari <dimitri.kellari@googlemail.com>\nTo: Madan, Spandan <spandan_madan@g.harvard.edu>\nTime: 2025-06-14T15:38:23-04:00\nSubject: Re: Introducing Memorious: Reimagining human memory using AI\n\nQuick update Spandan and Gabriel- I forwarded the deck to a few VCs.

As we are now moving into August, I'd love to meet again in the\r\nshort term, even before you have had a chance to review these documents, to\r\ndiscuss next steps.  I would like to talk about what mechanisms to apply\r\nfor, how to find other opportunities, and how to get started with the next\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nWhat I have seen so far is this one, which you sent me a few years back,\r\nbut it still seems active:\r\nhttps://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-291.html\r\nIt does talk about mental disorders in the RFA, and this proposal is about\r\nanxiety in epilepsy. I wonder if it's worth trying to play up the relevance\r\nfor anxiety disorders in general.\r\n\r\nI also think it makes sense to apply for a K01, K08, K23, or K99/R00.  I\r\nfound this one:\r\nhttps://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-215.html\r\n\r\nThis one sounds vaguely relevant, but seems to be about developing new\r\nrecording or neuromodulation technologies.\r\nhttps://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-NS-24-031.html\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what your availability is like in the next few weeks.\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDan\r\n\r\n ResearchStrategy4.docx\r\n<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eTPxrmiEElhK-LwjPzUxWU9FFVsqkBmY/view?usp=drive_web>\r\n SpecificAims_DW3.docx\r\n<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_LCU_haUDkIb8rozOSPpwi_Cg2pVACtT/view?usp=drive_web>\r\n\n---\n<https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-25-291.html>\n[...]\nI also think it makes sense to apply for a K01, K08, K23, or K99/R00.

I left all other cases untouched. As mentioned previously, I believe any human intervention in the model\u2019s answers carries risk. At minimum, our edits should never reduce the model\u2019s chances of being selected in the Turing Test. With this in mind, I found removing the \u201cdouble comma\u201d cases hard to justify because some may interpret such typographical quirks as a more human-like feature, potentially even a clever facet of the model\u2019s design. Overcorrecting these could draw unnecessary scrutiny from reviewers.\r\n\r\nWith this round of curation complete, I believe we\u2019re ready to proceed. If you both agree, I\u2019ll ask Spandan to share the test link with people he selected. \r\n\r\n(I didn\u2019t include Spandan in this email to avoid such detailed discussion about Turing Test choices influencing his Turing Test performance \u2014 he hasn\u2019t started it yet).\r\n\r\nThank you!\n---\n\n\nMessage 2\nFrom: Mengmi Zhang <a0091624@gmail.com>\nTo: Mingzhong Sun <mzsun024@gmail.com>\nTime: 2025-05-22T18:05:27+08:00\nSubject: Re: Spandan Turing Test\n\nAgree with your reasoning\r\nIn fact, I will leave the original intact.\r\n\r\nOk with the filtering since GK insisted doing so.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed to Turing tests\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMengmi\r\n\r\n*NOTE: Our lab has moved to NTU! *\r\n*Our lab: CIL@ N4-B1A-02; **My office: N3-02c-89 @ NTU*\r\n\r\nNanyang assistant professor and PI of Deep NeuroCognition Lab\r\nCollege of Computing and Data Science\r\nNanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore\r\nLab website: https://a0091624.wixsite.com/deepneurocognition-1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, May 22, 2025, 5:31\u202fPM Mingzhong Sun <mzsun024@gmail.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hi Gabriel and Mengmi,\r\n[...]\n> Thank you!\r\n>\r\n\n---\nLab website: <https://a0091624.wixsite.com/deepneurocognition-1>\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nOn Thu, May 22, 2025, 5:31 PM Mingzhong Sun <[mzsun024@gmail.com](mailto:mzsun024@gmail.com)> wrote:  \n[...]\n\n\nMessage 3\nFrom: Gabriel Kreiman <gkreiman@gmail.com>\nTo: Mengmi Zhang <a0091624@gmail.com>\nTime: 2025-05-22T08:07:16-04:00\nSubject: Re: Spandan Turing Test\n\nYes, let us move on to the Turing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, May 22, 2025 at 6:05\u202fAM Mengmi Zhang <a0091624@gmail.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Agree with your reasoning\r\n[...]\n>\r\n\r\n-- \r\nGabriel Kreiman\r\ngkreiman@gmail.com\r\nhttp://klab.tch.harvard.edu\r\n\n---\nYes, let us move on to the Turing tests. \n  \n\n  \n\nOn Thu, May 22, 2025 at 6:05 AM Mengmi Zhang <[a0091624@gmail.com](mailto:a0091624@gmail.com)> wrote:  \n[...]\n> Lab website: <https://a0091624.wixsite.com/deepneurocognition-1>\n[...]\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\\--   \n\nGabriel Kreiman  \n[gkreiman@gmail.com](mailto:gkreiman@gmail.com)\n<http://klab.tch.harvard.edu>",

You did not send a title, though. You do want a\r\ntitle when you send it to the Kempner folks.\r\nAlso, I would probably add a sentence along the lines of suggesting that\r\nthe observation that the model can lead to better human learning suggests\r\nthat perhaps it is on the right track as a model of human perception. Or at\r\nthe very least, it is not against this notion. But you do not need to add\r\nthis if you don't like the point.\r\n\r\nThanks for the DIA report, which I will read and submit.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Mar 5, 2025 at 10:58\u202fAM Morgan Talbot <mtalbot@mit.edu> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hi Gabriel,\r\n[...]\n>\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nGabriel Kreiman\r\ngkreiman@gmail.com\r\nhttp://klab.tch.harvard.edu\r\n\n---\nOn Wed, Mar 5, 2025 at 10:58 AM Morgan Talbot <[mtalbot@mit.edu](mailto:mtalbot@mit.edu)> wrote:  \n\n> Hi Gabriel,   \n[...]\n  \n\n  \n\n\\--   \n\nGabriel Kreiman  \n[gkreiman@gmail.com](mailto:gkreiman@gmail.com)\n<http://klab.tch.harvard.edu>\n\n\nMessage 3\nFrom: \"Morgan Talbot\" <mtalbot@mit.edu>\nTo: Gabriel Kreiman <gkreiman@gmail.com>\nTime: 2025-03-05T13:56:34-05:00\nSubject: Re: DIA report and Kempner talk abstract\n\nGood points - I have attached a revised version with a title and a note\r\nabout ANN/human alignment.

I wanted to reach out regarding a study\r\nwe recently submitted to *eLife* on trial-by-trial inter-areal interactions\r\nin the visual cortex. As you know, the paper was accepted for review. We\r\nrecently got the reviews, and one of the key reviewer recommendations is to\r\ninclude data from a second monkey to strengthen the analysis.\r\n\r\nThe open dataset we used does include a second monkey, but the number of\r\nworking V4 electrodes per day is quite limited\u2014especially in the *lights-off\r\ncondition*\u2014making it difficult to assess V4\u2192V1 predictability (we don\u2019t\r\nhave enough predictive power to model V1, since we only have 9-12\r\nelectrodes in V4 for those recording days).\r\n\r\n*We were wondering if you might have any monkeys implanted with electrodes\r\nin both V1 and V4* and, if so, whether recording in lights-off conditions\r\ncould be a possibility. If this sounds like something worth exploring, we\u2019d\r\nlove to set up a quick meeting to discuss potential options.\r\n\r\nWould you be open to a chat? Gabriel and I are happy to meet over Zoom or\r\nin person\u2014whatever works best for you.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your thoughts!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDianna\r\n\n---\n\n\nMessage 2\nFrom: \"Ponce, Carlos Ramon\" <carlos@hms.harvard.edu>\nTo: Hidalgo, Dianna <diannahidalgo@g.harvard.edu>\nTime: 2025-02-19T17:26:17+00:00\nSubject: Re: Meeting Request to Explore Potential Collaboration on Monkey\r\n V1-V4 Data\n\nYes, we have two monkeys with V1-V4 arrays.

Only 3 of these are the full 48 exchanges, and at least 4-5 conversations remain incomplete.\r\nGiven the time constraints, I'd like to close the dataset at 34 conversations rather than continuing to 50, which would require at least another week of data collection. Since each online participant will only read 32 conversations (with 3 catch trials fixed), I'll need to subsample anyway to extract around 9 human-human conversations. I can ensure one of the three long conversations is included per participant.\r\nDoes this approach work for you?\r\nI'm working on launching the study on Prolific by the end of today. However, I need clarification on our submission timeline. Are we still aiming to submit this Saturday (May 31st)? I won't be fully reachable for the next couple of days, so if this creates any issues, I need to adjust my schedule immediately.\r\nTo be transparent about expectations: if we maintain the current timeline, we can get results (hopefully!) and basic figures ready. However, for complete results with paper-quality figures, we'd likely need another week to week and a half.\r\nPlease let me know the exact submission date so I can plan accordingly.\r\nThanks, Elisa\r\n\r\n\r\n\n---\n\n\nMessage 2\nFrom: \"Pavarino, Elisa Catherine\" <epavarino@fas.harvard.edu>\nTo: gkreiman@gmail.com <gkreiman@gmail.com>\nTime: 2025-05-29T16:15:50+00:00\nSubject: Re: Urgent clarifications - thanks!\n\nUpdate - many of the conversations are not downloadable on my end, I get an \"internal server error\". This might require copying all the conversations by hand, as Singapore is sleeping now. This will set us back on time.

I saw that the SFN abstract\r\nsubmission deadline is now tomorrow, Thursday June 5th at 5pm. I was\r\nwondering if you thought it was a good idea to present Aim1? It would be my\r\nlast year attending as a grad student?\r\n\r\nI have an old abstract that I submitted for the kemper in neuroscience for\r\nyour reference.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how hierarchical processing, maturation, and robustness\r\nemerge in the primate visual system is a central challenge in neuroscience.\r\nDirectly studying these processes in biological neural circuits remains\r\ndifficult due to current technological limitations. Here, we use deep\r\nconvolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as biologically inspired models of\r\nthe primate visual system, leveraging their accessible connectivity\r\npatterns, activations, and performance metrics to generate concrete,\r\nexperimentally testable predictions about cortical function.\r\n   We investigate three biological hypotheses using DCNNs: (1) hierarchical\r\nmaturation of visual areas during development, (2) structured changes in\r\nnetwork representations during learning new visual tasks (plasticity), and\r\n(3) robustness differences across cortical areas when facing synaptic or\r\nneuronal perturbations. Our findings reveal that hierarchical maturation\r\nemerges naturally in DCNNs, with earlier visual layers maturing faster than\r\nlater ones\u2014consistent with developmental patterns observed in primates.\r\nFurthermore, during transfer learning, higher layers adapt more readily to\r\nnew tasks, suggesting a hierarchical structure in visual cortical\r\nplasticity. Finally, robustness tests demonstrate that higher-level\r\nrepresentations in strictly feedforward architectures (e.g., AlexNet) are\r\nsignificantly more resilient to synaptic and node perturbations compared to\r\nlower layers, whereas architectures with skip connections (e.g., ResNet)\r\nshow robustness dependent on circuit connectivity rather than strict\r\nhierarchical depth.\r\n   These findings hold consistently across multiple datasets and training\r\nmethods, including alternative biologically plausible training schemes such\r\nas forward direct feedback alignment (FDFA). By bridging biological theory\r\nand deep learning, our results propose testable predictions about visual\r\ncortical development, learning, and robustness, guiding future experimental\r\napproaches in NeuroAI research.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts?\r\nBest,\r\nDianna\r\n\n---\n\n\nMessage 2\nFrom: Gabriel Kreiman <gkreiman@gmail.com>\nTo: Hidalgo, Dianna <diannahidalgo@g.harvard.edu>\nTime: 2025-06-05T08:14:24-04:00\nSubject: Re: SFN 2025- Should I apply to present Aim1?\n\nSure.

With modern machine learning and new techniques that weave together theory of mind with vision, language, audio, social interactions, robotics, and storytelling, we intend to turn the shape of this curve from exponential to linear, determine its parameters per student, and predict which interventions optimize its parameters for every learner.\r\n*Status of Support: Pending\r\nName of PD/PI: Boris Katz\r\n*Source of Support: NSF\r\n*Primary Place of Performance: MIT\r\nProject/Proposal Start and End Date: (MM/YYYY) (if available): 042026 - 03/2028\r\n* Total Award Amount (including Indirect Costs): $900,000\r\n* Person Months per budget period Devoted to the Proposal/Active Project:\r\nYear (YYYY)\r\nPerson Months (##.##)\r\n1.   2025\r\n1.2\r\n2.   2026\r\n1.2\r\n3.   2027\r\n1.2\r\n4.   2028\r\n1.2\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nBoris\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Jun 20, 2025, at 2:15\u202fPM, Sarah Dundulis <sdundulis@mbl.edu> wrote:\r\n\r\nHi Andrei and Boris\r\n\r\nBesides this NIH pending proposal for BMM,  do you have any other pending proposals that were not disclosed in your NIH Other support that was submitted to NIDA ?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nSarah\r\n\r\n\n---\n**Date:** Friday, June 20, 2025 at 6:31 PM  \n[...]\nYear (YYYY) |  Person Months (##.##)  \n---|---  \n1.   2025  |  1.2  \n2.   2026 |  1.2  \n3.   2027 |  1.2  \n4.   2028 |  1.2  \n \nThank you.\n \nBoris\n \n  \n  \n\n> On Jun 20, 2025, at 2:15 PM, Sarah Dundulis <sdundulis@mbl.edu> wrote:\n[...]\n\n\nMessage 2\nFrom: Diane Cook <dcook@mbl.edu>\nTo: \n  - Sarah Dundulis <sdundulis@mbl.edu>\n  - Boris Katz <boris@csail.mit.edu>\nTime: 2025-06-21T12:21:00+00:00\nSubject: RE: Any pending grants\n\nHello all, I need the requested documents by 3 pm on Monday, June 23rd.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this important NIH request.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\nDiane\r\n\r\n\r\nDiane E.

These companies are not strictly competitors but they are somewhat\r\nclose to what we do. Any thoughts on this?\r\n\r\nTo answer the questions from your friend:\r\nMemorious will revolutionize how we interact with data. Instead of users\r\nchasing data, data will proactively come to you, where you need it and when\r\nyou need it. We are eliminating search and prompts. This is a key\r\ndistinction with companies that merely record and store data, or companies\r\nthat are simply summarizing meetings, etc.\r\nMemorious has two key products. (1) Memory-as-a-Service through an API\r\nwhere enterprises can directly use our algorithms so that their employees\r\nor users can proactively and directly access all their memories and data.\r\n(2) A stand-alone app on the phone for users to augment their cognition and\r\nbecome superhuman via perfect and infinite memory.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all your help!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Jun 23, 2025 at 3:12\u202fPM Hari Narayanan <harinarayanan2001@gmail.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Hi Professor,\r\n>\r\n> I'm putting together a quick intro to Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of\r\n[...]\n>\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nGabriel Kreiman\r\ngkreiman@gmail.com\r\nhttp://klab.tch.harvard.edu\r\n\n---\nOn Mon, Jun 23, 2025 at 3:12 PM Hari Narayanan <[harinarayanan2001@gmail.com](mailto:harinarayanan2001@gmail.com)> wrote:  \n[...]\n>   \n> \n> ![image.png](cid:ii_mc9h16o10)  \n> \n  \n\n  \n\n\\--   \n\nGabriel Kreiman  \n[gkreiman@gmail.com](mailto:gkreiman@gmail.com)\n<http://klab.tch.harvard.edu>\n---\nContent-Type:\timage/png; name=\"image.png\"\nContent-Disposition:\tattachment; filename=\"image.png\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding:\tbase64\nX-Attachment-Id:\tii_mc9h16o10\nContent-ID:\t<ii_mc9h16o10>\n\n\nMessage 8\nFrom: Gabriel Kreiman <gkreiman@gmail.com>\nTo: Hari Narayanan <harinarayanan2001@gmail.com>\nTime: 2025-06-24T13:18:04-04:00\nSubject: Re: Great Speaking Today\n\nHello Hari,\r\n\r\nSorry, I just realized that we already have a meeting with a16z this\r\nThursday.

I\u2019m happy to be a\r\nsounding board as you navigate the funding questions. I also think the\r\nfolks at Prod might have some valuable suggestions on that front.\r\n\r\nRegarding a16z, it\u2019s definitely worth considering whether a partnership\r\nmakes sense given their investments in competitors. In some cases, that can\r\nbe a positive if they bring deep knowledge of the market and can connect\r\nyou with customers or talent. However, if that\u2019s not the case, it might be\r\nworth holding off on a partnership for now, especially considering the\r\noverlap and potential conflict of interest. The degree of overlap matters\r\nhere, particularly since you have other strong funding sources lined up. I\r\nhope your meeting with them tomorrow goes well\u2014I'd recommend really probing\r\ntheir expertise and network in this space.\r\n\r\nAs for ongoing conversations, the great thing about all the firms (Sequoia,\r\nCoatue, Greenoaks, a16z) is their ability to invest at all stages, from\r\nseed through growth to IPO and beyond. I think it\u2019s always beneficial to\r\nhave these conversations and build relationships over time, even if just a\r\nwarm intro/no immediate transaction. If they do invest down the line, their\r\nname/stamp of approval can often unlock revenue and partnership\r\nopportunities. At the very least, they tend to have great connections and\r\nare often willing to provide excellent advice for free.\r\n\r\nThanks for the blurb on Memorious! Super helpful and makes a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if I can help in any other way.

Karenna died in a small plane crash on April 12th alongside her parents Michael Groff and Joy Saini, her brother Jared, her boyfriend James Santoro, and her brother&rsquo;s girlfriend Alexia Couyutas Duarte. They were traveling together to celebrate Karenna&rsquo;s 25th birthday and the Passover holiday.\n\nKarenna, a three-time gold medal winner, represented Maccabi USA in Women&rsquo;s Soccer at the 2017 Maccabiah in Israel, the 2019 European Maccabi Games in Budapest, and the 2023 Pan American Maccabi Games in Buenos Aires. She was a shining star on and off the field. Karenna captained the MIT Women&rsquo;s Soccer Team and finished her career ranked second all-time in career goals and points (assists and goals).\n\nKarenna was twice nominated for the prestigious NCAA Woman of the Year Award, which she received in 2022 for her work during the COVID-19 pandemic co-founding openPPE, helping to create a new design of masks for essential workers. At MIT, Karenna majored in biological engineering and worked as a research assistant at Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital and as an EMT with MIT&rsquo;s emergency services. She was a second-year student at the Grossman School of Medicine at NYU.\n\nOur thoughts in these difficult times are with the Groff family, in particular Karenna&rsquo;s sister Anika, a two-time medalist at the 2022 Maccabiah and the 2023 Pan American Games.\n\nIt is difficult to find the words to express the heartbreak of sudden loss, particularly of individuals with so much promise and commitment to serving others.

Karenna died in a small plane crash on April 12th alongside her parents Michael Groff and Joy Saini, her brother Jared, her boyfriend James Santoro, and her brother's girlfriend Alexia Couyutas Duarte. They were traveling together to celebrate Karenna's 25th birthday and the Passover holiday.  \n  \nKarenna, a three-time gold medal winner, represented Maccabi USA in Women's Soccer at the 2017 Maccabiah in Israel, the 2019 European Maccabi Games in Budapest, and the 2023 Pan American Maccabi Games in Buenos Aires. She was a shining star on and off the field. Karenna captained the MIT Women's Soccer Team and finished her career ranked second all-time in career goals and points (assists and goals).  \n[...]\nKarenna was twice nominated for the prestigious NCAA Woman of the Year Award, which she received in 2022 for her work during the COVID-19 pandemic co-founding openPPE, helping to create a new design of masks for essential workers. At MIT, Karenna majored in biological engineering and worked as a research assistant at Boston Children's Hospital and as an EMT with MIT's emergency services. She was a second-year student at the Grossman School of Medicine at NYU.  \n[...]\nOur thoughts in these difficult times are with the Groff family, in particular Karenna's sister Anika, a two-time medalist at the 2022 Maccabiah and the 2023 Pan American Games.  \n[...]\nPlease join Anika and Karenna's Maccabi teammates and coaches in sending your love and support.

Since you have an upcoming trip that includes Newark Liberty International (EWR) Airport, I thought you'd be interested in all we're doing to maintain the highest safety standards there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe past few weeks of headlines have put the United States' air traffic control system in the spotlight. Our hard-working air traffic controllers clearly need more staff and better technology, and the good news is that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a plan to make that happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut despite these challenges and constraints, there are many procedures in place to ensure your safety when you fly with us. As you can see in this \r\nhttps://click.enews.united.com/?qs=0fd23a27280884b85a5056cbf81d03974ac289a3da968f16792d4559eaf0f46b67bef4cf723954aff8bc9d54b684fb845670968caedf492796e22f2715754133 \r\nvideo from United Captain Miles Morgan , every United pilot is trained for a wide range of potential issues, including radar or communications outages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe truth is that all the flights in and out of EWR are absolutely safe. When there are FAA issues, such as technology outages or staffing shortages, the FAA requires all airlines to fly fewer aircraft to maintain the highest levels of safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, neither the FAA nor United will ever compromise on safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a great trip, and thank you for choosing United.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n Sincerely,\r\n \r\n\r\n Scott Kirby\r\n\r\n CEO\r\n\r\n United Airlines\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhttps://click.enews.united.com/?qs=0fd23a27280884b8f98d18dcd4fd0597a7fea7516a2e41650c26e911cdcc28df814acef7653ac6ca49172c54022ec15ab24eead2feaa7cea6e5a5b68c927d5cf \r\n\r\n Reservations\r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\nhttps://click.enews.united.com/?qs=0fd23a27280884b80a36eb33f70d7d0c1121466692e5a9b591565e04b415ddfaa9374ea65eca1c69f863d358e9ff3ce4a206c2fe89d3981a52c7e63eabce3921 \r\n\r\n Deals & offers\r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\nhttps://click.enews.united.com/?qs=0fd23a27280884b86875437a1b11bfc3ccc626c2a6ddd77880702b91f70a85efdd5cbcea04a847d0962bc31ebd39ae9761bdbd1a35dfab562c1d582ae6775670 \r\n\r\n MileagePlus(R)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nhttps://click.enews.united.com/?qs=0fd23a27280884b8e4bf6a6e77307e597daaeb30211747fa97c5f046b2ab5499945b64957895e39634469debaa16af550555adbbc84c9729c2ea8c58a3745542 \r\n\r\n My United\r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nhttps://click.enews.united.com/?qs=0fd23a27280884b89b4d16e9b2b792c47bf82a0a63a5da6f3dc4567df10ce65a32c51f899a4bd3307f82fe309d300783f75458411fdab90e486c3397d9b649d5 \r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\nhttps://click.enews.united.com/?qs=0fd23a27280884b8e8a6e3b3b2f134696fd91ecc93ef8d0433aa67162ade7cc5843c3f4732785cbad4520ddc8c513cc22710eb6f65ef8d3a6b2d5f300ff14944 \r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\nhttps://click.enews.united.com/?qs=0fd23a27280884b8dde489cf9a25df818ca01722920b5192f1e2f6cb91cc6dcc18fc83c93bc0cbc47dfbcf4604d9a2c65bbc9b56be15a692f382ca122e4460c1 \r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\nhttps://click.enews.united.com/?qs=0fd23a27280884b8161dd0c049bb2b40f54cbbb4b3234328b75bd4b7ec9a3eb51bb995ea03ccaa640b140ce406444c31939c6e0a64908c9e0a6faaecb90f8023 \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n TAR-11738 ET01 20250512 919509f743c55a1814db407fe91eb35c \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n This email was sent to \r\nhttps://click.enews.united.com/?qs=0fd23a27280884b837ead10ef75d139165347431964c1a2affba9bbc22011b745647cdc0bdaa88c3ac606e2a0fb10979121c467c35c8b5b841b042563ccd939b \r\ngkreiman@gmail.com  by United Airlines.\r\n\r\n Please do not reply to this email.

Since you have an upcoming trip that includes Newark Liberty International (EWR) Airport, I thought you'd be interested in all we're doing to maintain the highest safety standards there.  \n  \nThe past few weeks of headlines have put the United States' air traffic control system in the spotlight. Our hard-working air traffic controllers clearly need more staff and better technology, and the good news is that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a plan to make that happen.  \n  \nBut despite these challenges and constraints, there are many procedures in place to ensure your safety when you fly with us. As you can see in this [video from United Captain Miles Morgan](https://click.enews.united.com/u/?qs=9a0bd6c81c8dfd06c43a342c06eee34408e166dad4162a2be2f03a182498044c1bbdc9c9ff852dac8b00e0e5733f9e14a8b8834a2b24aab6706b1e233d769318), every United pilot is trained for a wide range of potential issues, including radar or communications outages.  \n  \nThe truth is that all the flights in and out of EWR are absolutely safe. When there are FAA issues, such as technology outages or staffing shortages, the FAA requires all airlines to fly fewer aircraft to maintain the highest levels of safety.  \n  \nIn short, neither the FAA nor United will ever compromise on safety.  \n  \nHave a great trip, and thank you for choosing United.   \n  \nSincerely,   \n---  \n|  |  | ![](https://image.enews.united.com/lib/fe32117371640475751372/m/1/ScottKirby_Sig_160x160.png) |   |  | Scott Kirby  \nCEO  \nUnited Airlines  \n---  \n   \n| ![](https://image.enews.united.com/lib/fe32117371640475751372/m/1/tmplt_footer_bar_desktop.png) | ![](https://image.enews.united.com/lib/fe32117371640475751372/m/1/tmplt_footer_bar_mobile.png)  \n---  \n|  |    \n---  \n|  [ Reservations ](https://click.enews.united.com/u/?qs=0fd23a27280884b8c02e13b017f11d03f13f86470bc7c94c1c8a928aebd2df832c1ee6e389a71cb214724dbeced1000949ab7320bc26cc8c9ddb620c63b6d8f4) |    |  [ Deals & offers ](https://click.enews.united.com/u/?qs=0fd23a27280884b8a993148ef6a5fbb4a14caaea09ad452756f31090e47a66fcf5dbb4cbe3db9a780b9da17fd7b7bdfe1cc3af82ba01648085c52733286acc04) |    |  [ MileagePlus\u00ae ](https://click.enews.united.com/u/?qs=0fd23a27280884b8f7953b9bbf0553487b10c5e7d58b77b37e3d8685aa84cc2e3d1dae4d8f4f3b5b3645e7568cfd65c975d1a6fb7ee21b27234e1d3b1056b527) |    |  [ My United ](https://click.enews.united.com/u/?qs=0fd23a27280884b8250a9776ccddb12f1c16571f6ad0879945786d8f03c3bacba404bfe596c2b36d74222e05b6be653e949e5895a1c8cd4a3cb687103084fb7d)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n   \n|  |  |  [ ![Follow us on Facebook](https://image.enews.united.com/lib/fe32117371640475751372/m/1/tmplt_facebook_v5.png) ](https://click.enews.united.com/u/?qs=0fd23a27280884b8bfe62af9486e9d2ef326158d93dd008380e6c1418c59903edc595ed3f728e6172571becf454e0fba29c3c79ce4fcf6b44205328eddc940a9) |    |  [ ![Follow us on Twitter](https://image.enews.united.com/lib/fe32117371640475751372/m/1/tmplt_twitter_V6.png) ](https://click.enews.united.com/u/?qs=0fd23a27280884b8d607c84e9f0de331fb875e3fb75413371c796053db45d63f0b0fe0ec6f3986a10702b3091bca3d840fe577f4b7cc4f1bf020b989c4cb6971) |    |  [ ![Follow us on YouTube](https://image.enews.united.com/lib/fe32117371640475751372/m/1/tmplt_youtube_v5.png) ](https://click.enews.united.com/u/?qs=0fd23a27280884b862b5667ba619ce6baf49adbe09b713362e3a965fb657329d9c88e1589a786955666ceb6d4b9e9afb26efa0906494db71842576912385233b) |    |  [ ![Follow us on Instagram](https://image.enews.united.com/lib/fe32117371640475751372/m/1/tmplt_instagram_v5.png) ](https://click.enews.united.com/u/?qs=0fd23a27280884b84f189d8a23dfdb205babf1cb1ebfc1c84ffd343aa6170ebf4a859bd3db72bb4d78f53a2c0592019550fe44cc9d91d5aa052efa638482df57)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n   \n|  |  TAR-11738 ET01 20250512 919509f743c55a1814db407fe91eb35c   \n---  \nThis email was sent to [gkreiman@gmail.com](https://click.enews.united.com/u/?qs=0fd23a27280884b8a1b40f319249c38dcee1138d09b1f35b9e8b877d235d3b319b5a31675eb75a853430d5129b38b70fd2d5c4452a26a3e29178176722b4ea39) by United Airlines.  \nPlease do not reply to this email.

Viendo\r\nel *limitado tiempo disponible,* lo l\u00f3gico hubiera sido  que la Asistente\r\ninformara esta situaci\u00f3n a AA, pidiendo que nos esperaran un par de\r\nminutos.

Llegamos al gate un par de minutos antes de las 8.29 am, pero la puerta\r\ndel avi\u00f3n ya estaba cerrada y nos impidieron abordar el vuelo.\r\n4.

Taxi hasta el lugar de salida del bus a Boston m\u00e1s el costo de los 2\r\npasajes correspondientes.\r\n5.3 Nuestro equipaje viaj\u00f3 a Boston en el vuelo 4376 - FELIZMENTE!. Qu\u00e9\r\nhubiera pasado si no hubiera sido asi? - y tuvimos que irlo a buscar al\r\nAeropuerto Logan a nuestro regreso\r\n5.4.

Below, you will find a range of health pointers and suggestions that can boost your lifespan based on your answers to our quiz questions.\r\n\r\nWe believe that around 80% of our personal health outcomes are a direct result of our choices, which is great! It means we have the power to make positive change.\r\n\r\nPlease note, this content is for educational and entertainment purposes only. Nothing you read online should be substituted for the advice of a good, trusted doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop Priority: Eating Habits\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are what you eat.\u201d An oldie but a goodie when it comes to longevity. Looking at your quiz results, we can see you describe your diet as \"A mix of everything (moderately healthy)\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re already building a strong foundation with healthy habits\u2014now let\u2019s take it to the next level. Once you've covered the basics, staying hydrated, packing your meals with high-fiber antioxidant and phytonutrient-rich vegetables, and swapping processed foods for whole foods, consider adding these to your nutrition goals:\r\n\r\nHydrate more: You know this, but we all need reminders. Even mild dehydration can impair energy and focus.\r\n\r\nDon't Skimp on Whole Fruit: Natural sugars paired with fiber help regulate blood sugar levels, reducing the risk of diabetes.\r\n\r\nPractice Mindful Eating: Slow down, savor each bite, and pay attention to your body\u2019s hunger and fullness cues. Mindful eating can prevent overeating and enhance digestion, making every meal more satisfying\r\n\r\nShift dessert to earlier in the day, like mid-afternoon. This timing allows your body to process the glucose spike more effectively and use it as fuel rather than storing it.\r\n\r\nConsider wearing a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). This small device tracks how your body responds to different foods in real time, offering personalized insights into your glucose trends. Are certain snacks spiking your blood sugar more than you thought? Is your go-to smoothie keeping you energized or causing an afternoon crash? A CGM can help you fine-tune your nutrition choices for peak energy and longevity. Try it for a month.\r\n\r\nThe journey to optimized nutrition isn\u2019t about perfection; it\u2019s about curiosity and refinement. With every tweak, you\u2019re aligning your habits with your goals for a longer, healthier, more vibrant life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop Priority: Exercise\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to exercise, we think momentum is key. Whatever your favorite way to get moving is, just keep doing it. Seeing as you exercise \"Almost every day or more\", here's what we think:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou get a gold star! Remember to stretch, and, when really pushing yourself, keep in mind that longevity-minded athletes take recovery just as seriously as the sport or workout itself. Use a foam roller to massage those muscles, hop in the sauna when you can, and stay consistent in how you maintain your output/recuperation balance.\r\n\r\nCurious about new ways to track your performance? Use a wearable tracker to get data on daily steps and sleep quality and to time our workouts.\r\n\r\nBonus: Make sure you're getting enough electrolytes in your diet to stay properly hydrated before, during, and after your workout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop Priority: Sleep\r\n\r\nWell done! It sounds like you make sleep a priority, given that you sleep 8+ hours per night. On the rare occasion you can\u2019t seem to doze off, sometimes it can be best to just \u201cgive up,\u201d get out of bed, and do something entirely different for a while before returning to the pillow. For us, a warm cup of herbal tea or a little yoga can do the trick. Want to gather data about your sleep quality? We use trackers like Whoop and Oura to get daily feedback on how well we slept.\r\n\r\nBonus: We\u2019d love to hear your go-to strategies for consistently sleeping well! Drop us a line at:  editor@superage.com [mailto:info@weareageist.com].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTop Priority: Stress\r\n\r\nJust like sleep, stress can have widespread effects on our mental health, immune system, and overall disposition. Seeing as your life is Somewhat negatively impacted by stress, here\u2019s the scoop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if stress doesn't seem to affect you much, it is still crucial to have stress management systems in place for long-term wellness and overall heart health. Next time you feel a bit frazzled, start lowering your stress levels by incorporating daily mindfulness practices, such as box breathing\r\n\r\nThis simple practice can switch your body out of fight or flight mode\u2013\u2013and is even  used by Navy Seals [https://time.com/4316151/breathing-technique-navy-seal-calm-focused/] ( they call it tactical breathing) to stay calm and focused. Here\u2019s how: Breathe out fully, emptying your lungs. Then, inhale through your nose for a slow count of four, feeling your lungs and stomach expand. Hold for four. Exhale for four. Hold again for four. Repeat this cycle for three to four rounds to reset and refocus. It works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks again for taking our Longevity Quiz!\r\n\r\nToday, we covered the top few pillars of longevity.

Below, you will find a range of health pointers and suggestions that can boost your lifespan based on your answers to our quiz questions.   \n[...]\n_Please note, this content is for educational and entertainment purposes only.

Looking at your quiz results, we can see you describe your diet as \"A mix of everything (moderately healthy)\" You're already building a strong foundation with healthy habits--now let's take it to the next level. Once you've covered the basics, staying hydrated, packing your meals with high-fiber antioxidant and phytonutrient-rich vegetables, and swapping processed foods for whole foods, consider adding these to your nutrition goals:\n[...]\n  * **Practice Mindful Eating** : Slow down, savor each bite, and pay attention to your body's hunger and fullness cues. Mindful eating can prevent overeating and enhance digestion, making every meal more satisfying\n[...]\nThe journey to optimized nutrition isn't about perfection; it's about curiosity and refinement. With every tweak, you're aligning your habits with your goals for a longer, healthier, more vibrant life.   **Top Priority: Exercise**   ![](https://i6.cmail19.com/ei/y/5A/A62/EA5/083516/temp_import/csfinal/A0010020-9900000000079e3c.jpg)   When it comes to exercise, we think momentum is key. **Whatever your favorite way to get moving is, just keep doing it.** Seeing as you exercise \"Almost every day or more\", here's what we think: You get a gold star! Remember to stretch, and, when really pushing yourself, keep in mind that longevity-minded athletes take recovery just as seriously as the sport or workout itself. Use a foam roller to massage those muscles, hop in the sauna when you can, and stay consistent in how you maintain your output/recuperation balance.Curious about new ways to track your performance? Use a wearable tracker to get data on daily steps and sleep quality and to time our workouts. Bonus: Make sure you're getting enough electrolytes in your diet to stay properly hydrated before, during, and after your workout.   **Top Priority: Sleep**   ![](https://i8.cmail19.com/ei/y/5A/A62/EA5/083516/temp_import/csfinal/c850c91b-34b1-ae81-880b-517caf501f5c1-9900000000079e3c.jpeg)   Well done! It sounds like you make sleep a priority, given that you sleep 8+ hours per night. On the rare occasion you can't seem to doze off, sometimes it can be best to just \"**give up** ,\" get out of bed, and do something entirely different for a while before returning to the pillow. For us, a warm cup of herbal tea or a little yoga can do the trick. Want to gather data about your sleep quality? We use trackers like Whoop and Oura to get daily feedback on how well we slept.  \n  \n**Bonus:** We'd love to hear your go-to strategies for consistently sleeping well! Drop us a line at: [editor@superage.com](mailto:info@weareageist.com). **Top Priority: Stress**   ![](https://i9.cmail19.com/ei/y/5A/A62/EA5/083516/temp_import/csfinal/7abe2a5c-3f86-6203-6133-2517073435e61-9900000000079e3c.jpeg)   Just like sleep, stress can have widespread effects on our mental health, immune system, and overall disposition. Seeing as your life is Somewhat negatively impacted by stress, here's the scoop.  Even if stress doesn't seem to affect you much, it is still crucial to have stress management systems in place for long-term wellness and overall heart health. Next time you feel a bit frazzled, start lowering your stress levels by incorporating daily mindfulness practices, such as box breathingThis simple practice can switch your body out of fight or flight mode--and is even **[used by Navy Seals](https://superage.cmail19.com/t/y-l-etlhkr-hjukfkyht-wt/) **( they call it tactical breathing) to stay calm and focused. Here's how: Breathe out fully, emptying your lungs. Then, inhale through your nose for a slow count of four, feeling your lungs and stomach expand. Hold for four. Exhale for four. Hold again for four. Repeat this cycle for three to four rounds to reset and refocus. It works.   **Thanks again for taking our Longevity Quiz!** Today, we covered the top few pillars of longevity.

Safety isn\u2019t up for debate \u2014 fairness and common sense are.\r\n\r\nMany residents tell me the overnight winter parking ban places an unfair burden on them. Elderly couples and single parents without driveways face the same challenge \u2014 finding a parking space, often blocks from home.\r\n\r\nOne mother told me she had to leave her children alone while she parked and walked back through the cold and dark, hoping everything would be fine. Seniors face similar risks. Renters often have only one driveway spot, forcing them to pay high prices for winter parking. Families in older homes without driveways sometimes end up paving over front yards, just to comply.\r\n\r\nPolicies should fit the realities of residents\u2019 lives. A modern, flexible approach can protect safety and fairness \u2014 ensuring clear streets during storms while respecting how people actually live.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOver the years, I\u2019ve proposed:\r\n* A parking overlay district in neighborhoods most affected by university parking\r\n* A trial program in parts of Wards 2 and 3 to test more flexible approaches\r\n* A review of narrow streets to allow year-round parking on only one side, where needed for safety\r\n\r\nNone of these ideas gained traction in the Council, and that's why I believe the repeal deserves your yes vote to make the Council pay attention.   When this passes, the Council and Traffic Council will revisit parking policy, and I\u2019ll work hard to ensure practical, balanced parking rules that serve everyone in Newton.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n** \ud83c\udf33 My take on Our Community Values\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMy endorsements in this election reflect what I believe to be Newton\u2019s core values \u2014 shaped by growing up here, raising my family here, and  a review across city departments, including the school department in the 2025-26 budget  mission statements, which show some clear shared themes:\r\n* Equity and inclusion \u2014 ensuring access, dignity, and fairness for all residents\r\n* Sustainability \u2014 environmentally responsible infrastructure and fiscal health\r\n* Public safety and quality of life \u2014 responsive services and well-maintained spaces\r\n* Accountability and transparency \u2014 professionalism and collaboration in city government\r\n\r\nTogether, these values describe Newton\u2019s vision of a safe, fair, and sustainable community that works for everyone.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n** \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f City Council Endorsements\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn this election, I\u2019m supporting candidates in contested races who embody these values \u2014 people who lead with integrity, respect, and a genuine commitment to inclusion and good governance.\r\n* Ward 6 At-Large: Sean Roche (https://www.seanroche.org/)\r\n* Ward 4 At-Large: Cyrus Dahmubed (https://www.cyrus4newton.org/) and Josh Krintzman (https://www.facebook.com/krintzmanforcitycouncil/)\r\n* Ward 5 (Ward Councilor Race): Gary Miller (https://miller4newton.org/)\r\n* Ward 1 (Ward Councilor Race): Maria Greenberg (https://maria-for-ward-1.mailchimpsites.com/)  (her opponent withdrew but is still on the ballot)\r\n\r\nThe third candidate in the Ward 4 race has made public comments showing a lack of understanding and empathy toward transgender youth. He states that his Facebook posts were simply a way to learn more about transgender kids.  Here are some of his clarifying statements in the Newton Beacon (https://www.newtonbeacon.org/chaimanis-takes-heat-for-facebook-comments-regarding-protections-for-transgender-students/) : \u201cI have learned that some of the ways I worded my concerns were hurtful. That was never my intention, and I am sorry for any pain or harm I caused.\" His remarks at the Area Council debate (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNINt4sK5f4)  (his comments start at minute 40:49 of the recording) didn\u2019t clarify what, if anything, he has learned. Transgender kids are more likely to be bullied than to cause harm to others.  We need leaders who understand that trans kids (and others who are marginalized)  need support and protection, not skepticism.\r\n\r\nJosh and Cyrus will support our values, supporting marginalized students as well as supporting our kids and teachers.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n** \ud83c\udf93 The School Committee Races\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI\u2019m deeply concerned about the tone of this year\u2019s School Committee campaigns. Some of the rhetoric has become personal and divisive \u2014 and that\u2019s not who we are as a community.\r\n\r\nA School Committee race should be about what matters most \u2014 our students, our teachers, and the future of Newton\u2019s schools. It\u2019s about electing people who listen, collaborate, and focus on helping every child succeed. The committee\u2019s job isn\u2019t politics \u2014 it\u2019s working with the Superintendent, setting smart policies, and making sure every student in every school has access to a great education in a supportive, inclusive environment. That\u2019s what Newton\u2019s families expect and deserve.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m troubled by claims that certain candidates \u2014 or that I myself \u2014 \u201chate teachers.\u201d  As someone who served on the School Committee for eight years, including four on the negotiations committee, I have enormous respect for Newton\u2019s educators. Disagreeing about policy or candidates isn\u2019t the same as devaluing teachers.\r\n\r\nThose spreading that message are deepening divisions that we must work to heal if we want our schools \u2014 and our city \u2014 to thrive.\r\n\r\nHere are the candidates I\u2019m supporting in contested races:\r\n* Ward 2: Linda Swaine (https://www.swainforschools.com/)\r\n* Ward 5: Ben Schlesinger (https://ben4newton.com/)\r\n* Ward 6: Jonathan Greene (https://www.jonathan4newton.com/)\r\n* Ward 8: Victor Lee (https://www.victor4newton.com/)\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve known Jonathan and Ben since they were 5 years old. They\u2019re thoughtful, honest, and deeply committed to reflecting Newton\u2019s values. Each of these candidates cares about and respects our teachers, our students, and the strength of our public schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n** In Closing\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNewton\u2019s strength has always been its people \u2014 thoughtful, compassionate residents who believe in fairness and community. Whether it\u2019s parking reform, inclusive leadership, or supporting our schools, we can and should act with empathy and common sense.\r\n\r\nThank you for caring, voting, and helping to keep Newton a city that works for everyone.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n** \ud83d\udfe2 P.S.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHere are Vibrant Newton\u2019s Endorsements for the 2025 City Council election:\r\n\ud83d\udc49 https://www.vibrantnewton.org/2025endorsements.html\r\n\r\n\r\n** \ud83d\udfe3 P.P.S.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease vote for me too: SUSAN ALBLRIGHT COUNCILOR-AT-LARGE WARD 2!!!!\r\n\r\nP.P.S.\r\nPaid for by the Committee to Elect Susan Albright.\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n** Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/susan.albright.7798/)\r\n** Website (https://susanalbright.org)\r\n\r\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\r\nYou can ** update your preferences (https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/profile?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=853b15bd5d&e=b17321f7b4&c=548df7ad8e)\r\nor ** unsubscribe from this list (https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=853b15bd5d&t=b&e=b17321f7b4&c=548df7ad8e)\r\n.\n---\n|  |  |  |  [View this email in your browser](https://mailchi.mp/d4bcdd37e2be/leadership-and-parking?e=b17321f7b4)  \n---  \n|  |  |  ![](https://mcusercontent.com/0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6/images/001c1014-e675-a82a-464c-79ef07fa4636.png)  \n---  \n|  |  | \n## \ud83c\udfd9\ufe0f A Fairer Newton: Smarter Parking Policies and Leaders Who Share Our Values  \n  \n  \nLet's Repeal the Winter Parking Ban \u2014 Keep the Snow Emergency in Place  \n  \n** ** The ballot question to repeal the winger ban is something I've worked on for six years.  \n  \nLet\u2019s start with reassurance: **the Snow Emergency Winter Parking Ban will remain in place**  regardless of the outcome of this vote.

Here are some of his clarifying statements in the [Newton Beacon](https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=a581be41a4&e=b17321f7b4): \u201c _I have learned that some of the ways I worded my concerns were hurtful. That was never my intention, and I am sorry for any pain or harm I caused_ _.\"_  His remarks at the [Area Council debate ](https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=89a30ebbf2&e=b17321f7b4) (his comments start at minute 40:49 of the recording) didn\u2019t clarify what, if anything, he has learned. Transgender kids are more likely to be bullied than to cause harm to others.  We need leaders who understand that **trans kids (and others who are marginalized)   need support and protection, not skepticism**.   \n  \n**Josh and Cyrus will support our values,** supporting marginalized students as well as supporting our kids and teachers.\n* * *\n## \ud83c\udf93 The School Committee Races\nI\u2019m deeply concerned about the **tone of this year\u2019s School Committee campaigns**. Some of the rhetoric has become personal and divisive \u2014 and that\u2019s not who we are as a community.  \n  \nA School Committee race should be about **what matters most \u2014 our students, our teachers, and the future of Newton\u2019s schools**. It\u2019s about electing people who listen, collaborate, and focus on helping every child succeed. The committee\u2019s job isn\u2019t politics \u2014 it\u2019s working with the Superintendent, setting smart policies, and making sure every student in every school has access to a great education in a supportive, inclusive environment. That\u2019s what Newton\u2019s families expect and deserve. I\u2019m troubled by claims that certain candidates \u2014 or that I myself \u2014 \u201chate teachers.\u201d  As someone who served on the School Committee for eight years, including four on the negotiations committee, I have enormous respect for Newton\u2019s educators. **Disagreeing about policy or candidates  isn\u2019t the same as devaluing teachers.** Those spreading that message are deepening divisions that we must work to heal if we want our schools \u2014 and our city \u2014 to thrive. Here are the candidates I\u2019m supporting in contested races:\n  * **Ward 2:** [Linda Swaine](https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=4a7075e49f&e=b17321f7b4)\n  * **Ward 5:** [Ben Schlesinger](https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=a90ace1dbe&e=b17321f7b4)\n  * **Ward 6:** [Jonathan Greene](https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=7d100284e2&e=b17321f7b4)\n  * **Ward 8:** [Victor Lee](https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=a4828d3d35&e=b17321f7b4)\n\nI\u2019ve known Jonathan and Ben since they were 5 years old. They\u2019re thoughtful, honest, and deeply committed to reflecting Newton\u2019s values. Each of these candidates cares about and respects our teachers, our students, and the strength of our public schools.  \n \n## **In Closing**\nNewton\u2019s strength has always been its people \u2014 thoughtful, compassionate residents who believe in fairness and community. Whether it\u2019s parking reform, inclusive leadership, or supporting our schools, we can and should act with empathy and common sense. Thank you for caring, voting, and helping to keep Newton a city that works for everyone.\n* * *\n### \ud83d\udfe2 P.S.\nHere are **Vibrant Newton\u2019s Endorsements** for the 2025 City Council election:  \n\ud83d\udc49 [https://www.vibrantnewton.org/2025endorsements.html](https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=1e0d7bfd7d&e=b17321f7b4)\n### \ud83d\udfe3 P.P.S.\n_Please vote for me too:  SUSAN ALBLRIGHT COUNCILOR-AT-LARGE WARD 2!!!!_  \n  \nP.P.S.  \n_Paid for by the Committee to Elect Susan Albright._  \n---  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  [![Facebook](https://cdn-images.mailchimp.com/icons/social-block-v2/color-facebook-48.png)](https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=516692710c&e=b17321f7b4)  \n---  \n|  |  [![Website](https://cdn-images.mailchimp.com/icons/social-block-v2/color-link-48.png)](https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=922e3dca61&e=b17321f7b4)  \n---  \n|   \n---  \n|    \n  \n  \n  \nWant to change how you receive these emails?  \nYou can [update your preferences](https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/profile?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=853b15bd5d&e=b17321f7b4&c=548df7ad8e) or [unsubscribe from this list](https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=853b15bd5d&t=b&e=b17321f7b4&c=548df7ad8e).  \n  \n   \n---  \n![](https://susanalbright.us17.list-manage.com/track/open.php?u=0f0558371bcf70d83eb7040a6&id=548df7ad8e&e=b17321f7b4)",

He has been a strong champion for climate action, housing and the schools. And very importantly recognizes that reasonable and appropriate development is essential for building a fiscally sustainable future, as a diverse, inclusive and accessible community.

As an architect and urban planner, his professional skills will be invaluable to the City Council, especially on the more complicated and contentious issues the Council deals with concerning land use and village center projects. His experience in community engagement for design informs his \"listen first, then design solutions together\" approach to getting work done and solving problems collaboratively.

He is thoughtful, inclusive and fact-based and has decades of experience working collaboratively for better solutions. Sean understands the need to develop housing options across stages of life and the economic spectrum and that housing is one of the most effective steps Newton can take to address the climate crisis. And to support people of all ages, Newton must make significant improvements in transportation and mobility and that housing and better transportation options are key to sustainable, vibrant village centers. You can learn more about Sean at his website: https://www.seanroche.org/.\r\nContested Ward City Council Races\r\nWard Councilors are elected only by the voters who live in their ward and voters can vote for one candidate per ward\r\nWard 5:\r\nK. Garrett Miller\r\nK. Garrett Miller, more commonly known as Garry, is a longtime Newton resident who is ready to do even more to give back to the community he loves, with constituent services being his #1 focus. His decades of work as a software engineer in the healthcare industry means he has built strong communication skills and is comfortable navigating complex environments. Garry supports a more open, transparent and accountable city government and believes we can build consensus on the major issues: supporting great public education, repairing our roads and other infrastructure, improving our parks, and working on climate transition and mitigation all while putting the city budget  on a more sustainable, long-term course. With so many costs out of the city's control, the more dependable avenue is to attract more economic activity by making the city a more attractive place to do business and by allowing more development, both commercial and residential. Garry is committed to being a councilor who listens\r\n(and hears).

She has worked with communities to solve tough problems as a public interest lawyer, a policy advocate, and a nonprofit leader. Jenna has the experience of collective bargaining both as an employer and a union member, and she is committed to building a healthy and productive relationship with the unions.

My wife, Gina Marzilli, and I worked hard\r\nto move to Newton to raise our family here because we know just\r\nhow truly special this city is. Our kids attend the Newton Public\r\nSchools because we believe in public education, and we live in a\r\nmultigenerational household, because we believe in taking care of\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nI want to continue my lifetime of service by offering the City\r\nCouncil my proven experience as a business owner, finance\r\nprofessional, and clean energy leader.\r\n\r\nAfter earning a degree in finance, I turned down Wall Street to\r\nvolunteer-teach science and math to middle schoolers in Roxbury.\r\nI then co-founded a school in inner-city Boston (photo at the\r\nbottom), where I managed all business and operations. Education\r\nhad been my gift; giving it back became my duty. In 2005, I\r\nredirected my passion for greater impact - fighting climate\r\nchange, which affects all of humanity. A decade ago, I founded a\r\nclean energy company that has already financed projects producing\r\nenough clean energy to power over 25,000 homes.\r\n\r\nMy record shows I deliver measurable results. I will bring\r\nfinancial expertise to the City Council - an essential skill that\r\nis underrepresented on the Council today.\r\n\r\nAs your representative, I will work hard, I will learn, and I\r\nwill grow. I will listen to residents, strengthen transparency,\r\nand ground decisions in data and community input.\r\n\r\nI humbly ask for your vote,\r\n\r\nJohn Chaimanis, Ward 4 At Large Candidate\r\n\r\n-->Learn More About Where John Stands on the Issues

Margaret Albright   \n---  \n\u200b Dear Newton Voters: I'd like to share a little bit more about me, as you make your decisions this coming Tuesday, November 4th.  I am the son of an immigrant father and a single working mother who instilled in me the values of looking for good in everyone, giving back, and hard work. Anyone who knows me, knows that I fight for social justice in education, against poverty, and for our common home\u2014the Earth. While I was not born in Newton, my three children are fifth generation Newtonians. My wife, Gina Marzilli, and I worked hard to move to Newton to raise our family here because we know just how truly special this city is. Our kids attend the Newton Public Schools because we believe in public education, and we live in a multigenerational household, because we believe in taking care of family.  _I want to continue my lifetime of service by offering the City Council my proven experience as a business owner, finance professional, and clean energy leader._ After earning a degree in finance, I turned down Wall Street to volunteer-teach science and math to middle schoolers in Roxbury. I then co-founded a school in inner-city Boston (photo at the bottom), where I managed all business and operations. Education had been my gift; giving it back became my duty. In 2005, I redirected my passion for greater impact - fighting climate change, which affects all of humanity. A decade ago, I founded a clean energy company that has already financed projects producing enough clean energy to power over 25,000 homes.  My record shows I deliver measurable results. I will bring financial expertise to the City Council - an essential skill that is underrepresented on the Council today. As your representative, I will work hard, I will learn, and I will grow. I will listen to residents, strengthen transparency, and ground decisions in data and community input.

At the end of March, we will wrap up the current phase of public engagement focused on **Allston, Brighton, Fenway/Kenmore, and Mission Hill.** We held three open houses and published [digital surveys](https://link.hello.boston.gov/c/443/2ed469c207e25eea10ec22d4479eaa72d63a61bcefdbdcd726e99d4ee87da7d4fe90c21a8f89966b) for each of the neighborhoods. The surveys will close on March 31, 2025. We aim to announce which sites from this phase have been prioritized for installation in April.  \n  \nLater this spring, we'll share potential sites for new stations in Dorchester, Jamaica Plain, Mattapan, and Roxbury.

In 2022, more than 90 percent of the senior class joined us for Celebration, where they enjoyed a variety of entertainment, music, food, and prizes--all at no charge to them. Celebration 2023 (https://web.northptso.org/site/celebration-2023/) brings about a fantastic transformation of the public areas of the school, and it takes many volunteers and a lot of money to execute.\r\n\r\nParents/guardians in all grades are needed to pull off this important prevention event*. For those of us who don't have a senior, this is our opportunity to\r\n* See our friends and make new ones\r\n* Get an insider's view of Celebration before our students attend in two years\r\n* Help make Newton the kind of safe community we want to live in\r\n\r\nHere are three fantastic ways to support Celebration with a click:\r\n1. Volunteer here. (https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20f094eadaa23a3f58-celebration4#/)  Invite a friend to join you for a few hours of volunteering!\r\n2. Make a monetary donation here. (https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=KUKMFE4RVQE5J&source=qr4)\r\n3. Donate gift cards for the prize drawing table.  100 gift cards are still needed to entice seniors!

Your recent order was for over $1,000 within a 30-calendar\r\nday period, and you selected your account address for delivery, so it was\r\ncanceled.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to submit a new request and have it delivered to a financial\r\ncenter. We're sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nHere's what you can do.\r\nPlease place a new order through one of these ways:\r\n- Online at www.bankofamerica.com/foreigncurrency, or use our Mobile\r\n  Banking app and type \"Order Foreign Currency\" in the search field.\r\n  Follow the on-screen prompts to select your currency type, amount,\r\n  shipping, and delivery options.\r\n\r\n- In person by visiting one of our full-service financial centers.

Sam Churchill)  \n> ---  \n> | | Eighty-seven years ago, on November 9\u201310, 1938, the **Kristallnacht Pogrom** marked a turning point in history. Across Germany and Austria, Nazi-led mobs burned and looted more than 1,400 synagogues and thousands of Jewish-owned businesses, murdered scores of Jews, and sent some 30,000 to concentration camps. The shattered glass that covered the streets became a warning of what was to follow \u2014 the murder of six million Jews and the destruction of centuries of Jewish life across Europe.  \n> Today, the same forces of **hatred and extremism** are once again on the rise. According to the ADL, nearly half of adults worldwide \u2014 over two billion people \u2014 hold antisemitic views. In 2023 alone, antisemitic incidents in the U.S. rose by 140%, while attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions spiked globally after Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023 massacre in Israel. From Manchester to Washington, D.C., Jews are once again being targeted simply for being Jewish.  \n> Attacks against Jews and Jewish targets have dramatically spiked around the world following the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. Most recently, two people were murdered during a terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue in England on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar. Just a few months prior to that, two young Israeli embassy staffers were murdered by a terrorist gunman in Washington, D.C. Other attacks on Jewish and Israeli institutions have occurred recently in Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Denmark, and Poland.  \n> **Holocaust survivors** who witnessed Kristallnacht and have marched with the International March of the Living express deep alarm at these trends, warning that the atmosphere today echoes the darkest days of their youth. **Walter Bingham** (101), **George Shefi** (94), and **Paul Alexander** (90) were all children in Germany during Kristallnacht. Their message today is clear: the world has learned nothing. We must act now \u2014 through education, remembrance, and moral courage \u2014 to confront antisemitism and all forms of hatred before history repeats itself.  \n> ---  \n> | [READ THEIR MESSAGE](https://motl.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=22b61782cca978fed7817f5e3&id=aac17d0159&e=1042dbee8e)  \n> ---  \n> | | Two years ago, they retraced their childhood escape from Nazi Germany.

In 1942, Eve received a visa to the US where she lived for the duration of war. As an adult, Eve worked as a journalist in the US before moving to London in 1990.Through her educational efforts in the UK and beyond, including her participation for over a decade in the March of the Living, Eve educated thousands of young people about the history and lessons of the Holocaust. In 2022 she made a historic visit to Dubai, giving her testimony on Kristallnacht.  \n> _\"Learning what happened to the Jewish people, how terrible it was, and you know, how six million people, including over a million children, perished.

But reality is painfully different. We are seeing Jews murdered in Manchester and Amsterdam, banned from football stadiums, and even arrested for wearing a Magen David. Most disturbingly, I hear our youth - students - calling for renewed violence on university campuses.  \n> It feels like my duty and my privilege to uphold Jewish life wherever I can. I find strength in the stories of our community, in our collective resilience, and in our shared will to survive. This spirit was solidified for me on March of the Living last spring. Listening to Holocaust survivors, hearing their stories of endurance and renewal, reminded me that Jewish survival is not only about living through tragedy; it is about choosing life after it.  \n> Together, we marched.

A person who asks questions. A person who\r\nis fully human (mistakes and all).\r\n\u200b\r\nI\u2019ve lived my life fighting for social justice in education,\r\npoverty and for the environment, not telling people that they\r\nshould be doing something, but just doing what I could to make a\r\npositive impact - listening to stakeholders and finding solutions\r\nto move the ball forward for the common good.\r\n\u200b\r\nAn independent thinker questions all sides - preconceived\r\nnotions, assumptions and motives.

The billing statement for your CIEE Study Program is attached to this message. FOR STUDENTS STUDYING IN MULTIPLE CIEE LOCATIONS, you will receive an updated billing statement reflecting all program fees for all locations within 7 business days. Also attached is payment remittance information.\r\nA copy of this billing statement can also be viewed in your CIEE online account. To view the statement there:\r\n\r\nLog onto your CIEE My Account and open your current program application.  Scroll down the page and you will see billing statements listed by date under the header titled FINANCIAL INFORMATION.\r\n\r\nPlease note that you may be billed for some components of your study abroad program by your home college or university, but you are responsible for paying CIEE for all fees shown on your CIEE billing statement.

Vas a seguir teniendo buena insurance por medio de Harvard con Blue Cross Blue Shield, asi que va a ser facil que continues con los mismos medicos, etc.\r\n\r\nHay que hacer un tramite en diciembre - acordemonos durante el Winter Break!!\r\n\r\nThis is the info I gathered:\r\n\r\nHOW TO CHANGE OR CANCEL COVERAGE You cannot make changes to your coverage outside of the Open Enrollment Period unless you experience  a life-changing event. Enrollment Due to Life-Changing Events Typically, you may add coverage for you or a dependent within 45 days of a life-changing event, which may include \u2022 entry into the country, \u2022 loss of other health insurance coverage, \u2022 marriage, \u2022 birth of a child, legal adoption, or legal guardianship. The coverage and cost are prorated to the date of the life-changing event. To make a change to your coverage outside of the Open Enrollment Period, you must submit documentation to Member Services at 617-495-2008 or mservices@huhs.harvard.edu<mailto:mservices@huhs.harvard.edu>.\r\n\r\n\u2022 All Harvard students are automatically enrolled in HUSHP and pay the  Student Health Fee (SHF). \u2022 The Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) provides a critical safety  net to ensure that all students, regardless of location, have access  to quality and affordable health care. \u2022 Charges are applied to student accounts and will show up as two separate line items: one for SHF and one for SHIP.\r\n\r\nHOW TO RE-ENROLL IF YOU\u2019VE WAIVED COVERAGE Students who previously waived coverage from the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) and/or the Student Health Fee (SHF) may be eligible to re-enroll in one or both parts of Harvard University Student Health Program (HUSHP) under certain conditions. Criteria for rescinding waivers 1. Loss of alternative insurance no more than 60 days ago: The student must submit a waiver-rescind application to Member Services, along with official documentation of the loss of coverage. Documentation must show the student\u2019s name and exact termination date. The cost of SHIP will be prorated to the first day of the effective date of coverage. 2. Loss of alternative insurance 61 or more days ago: The student must submit a waiver-rescind application to Member Services, along with official documentation of the loss of coverage. Documentation must show the student\u2019s name and exact termination date. The cost of SHIP will be prorated to the first day of the effective date of coverage. The student will be assessed a penalty fee of $150 for each calendar month beyond the allowed 60 days. Coverage can be reinstated up to 102 days from the date that HUSHP Member Services receives a completed application or the beginning of the term of coverage, whichever is sooner. 3. Without a loss of insurance before the waiver deadline: The student must submit a waiver-rescind application to Member Services. The student will be enrolled effective on the start date of the term they are applying to rescind. The student will be charged a $50 processing fee. The cost of the plan is not prorated. 4. Without a loss of insurance after the waiver deadline: The student will not be allowed to enroll in SHIP until the following coverage term.

Please check to be sure it is accurate.  If you have any corrections or comments, kindly send them to us in the body of an e-mail to info@renwkd.org<mailto:info@renwkd.org> (rather than within the attached document).  Please note:  we do not need phone numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the gathering's program consists of presentations by all participants and therefore is not organized until about one month before the Weekend, we'll be proposing your lecture, seminar, and/or panel assignments at that time.  Little, if any preparation, will be necessary, as the sessions are curated to prompt participant's customary presentations and will focus on your specific expertise.  And the sessions are all highly informal and off-the-record.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our invitation letter noted, we would be pleased to waive Registration Fees and provide one room & Common Meals for you and your accompanying family (sons & daughters ages 21 or younger) from the first evening program through the final morning session.  Transportation would be your responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tentative Program and Program Assignments will be sent to you by e-mail approximately two weeks prior to the start of the Weekend.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to let us know.  Your participation will certainly help ensure that this will be yet another memorable Renaissance Weekend.\r\n\r\nWith thanks and regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRenaissance Weekend\r\ninfo@renwkd.org | www.RenaissanceWeekend.org\r\nPost Office Box 22049, Charleston, \r\nSC 29413\r\n\n---\nAttached is the information we have in our Renaissance Weekend records for you and your family/guest(s).

Please check to be sure it is accurate.  If you have any corrections or comments, kindly send them to us in the body of an e-mail to info@renwkd.org<mailto:info@renwkd.org> (rather than within the attached document).  Please note:  we do not need phone numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the gathering's program consists of presentations by all participants and therefore is not organized until about one month before the Weekend, we'll be proposing your lecture, seminar, and/or panel assignments at that time.  Little, if any preparation, will be necessary, as the sessions are curated to prompt participant's customary presentations and will focus on your specific expertise.  And the sessions are all highly informal and off-the-record.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our invitation letter noted, we would be pleased to waive Registration Fees and provide one room & Common Meals for you and your accompanying family (sons & daughters ages 21 or younger) from the first evening program through the final morning session.  Transportation would be your responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tentative Program and Program Assignments will be sent to you by e-mail approximately two weeks prior to the start of the Weekend.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to let us know.  Your participation will certainly help ensure that this will be yet another memorable Renaissance Weekend.\r\n\r\nWith thanks and regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n---\nCorrection, with apologies:  We look forward to welcoming you to the Labor Day Renaissance Weekend in Monterey.\n \nRegards,\n \n| | ![](cid:image351453.jpg@1042C1EE.A181C546)| | | Renaissance Weekend  \n---  \n| [info@renwkd.org](mailto:info@renwkd.org)|  | | [www.RenaissanceWeekend.org](http://www.renaissanceweekend.org/)  \n---|---|---  \n| | Post Office Box 22049| , | Charleston| ,   \n| SC | 29413  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n    \n**From:** Renaissance Weekend   \n[...]\nAttached is the information we have in our Renaissance Weekend records for you and your family/guest(s).

Attached please find your: REGISTRATION CONFIRMATION, PROGRAM ASSIGNMENTS and the TENTATIVE PROGRAM. To meet our printer\u2019s deadline, please respond immediately:\r\n\r\n1)\t REPLY to confirm receipt of these materials: 'Got it! No changes requested,' or, if necessary, 'These are my urgent requests . . .'\r\n\r\n2)\t FORWARD these materials to all members of your party.  \r\n\r\n3) \tCarefully read all attachments and review your PROGRAM ASSIGNMENTS:\r\n\r\n*  Especially CHECK THE TIMES of your assigned roles to be sure they don't conflict with your arrival or departure times. \r\n*  Kindly limit any requests for changes to factual errors or extremely strong preferences not to participate as requested. We regret that only requests received by the deadline (12pm EST on August 14th) can be considered for the final program.\r\n\r\n4) \tInform us of any ERRORS in your attached registration or nametag info. If the professional title of anyone in your party is truly INCORRECT (see PAGE 3 of your Program Assignments PDF), we\u2019ll try to adjust it within space constraints.\r\n\r\n5)\t As you review these materials, we encourage you to take a deep breath and relax. Our gatherings are informal and conversational opportunities to learn from and LISTEN to each other. All participants are far more accomplished than the program\u2019s limited bio references can convey, and we apologize for inevitable omissions of noteworthy items. \r\n\r\n6)\t To attend ANY session, you need not be \u201cassigned\u201d to it. Few sessions require any significant preparation; and all seek to be only \u201cconversation-starters\u201d to prompt the informal chats central to the Weekend\u2019s enjoyment. \r\n\r\n7)\t Confirm and raise any questions about accommodations directly with your hotel. Read the previously sent and attached Guide to R/W re: attire.\r\n\r\n8) \t\t\tBe sure to make meal reservations for the ON-YOUR-OWN Dinner (Saturday, August 30th) and Lunch (Sunday, August 31st).\r\n\r\n9) On-site REGISTRATION begins THURSDAY, August 28th, at 4 pm, in the Cypress Foyer at the Monterey Plaza Hotel. There you\u2019ll receive the Final Program and Assignments \u2013 which may differ considerably from the attached materials. The List of Participants will be included in your printed program; we do not send it or the Final Program electronically. Thank you for understanding.\r\n\r\n10) Afternoons are left unscheduled: Friday from 3:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M.; Saturday from 3:00 P.M. through the evening, including dinner on your own, and Sunday from 1:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M., including lunch on your own,  for participants' personal recreation. \r\n\r\nFirst-time participants are invited to R/W 101, an elective pre-registration briefing by long-time participants to help optimize your Renaissance experience. Also, at the Welcome Reception and throughout the Weekend, past participants \u2013 wearing white nametags, with newcomers sporting blue ones \u2013 will be pleased to answer questions and convey this gathering\u2019s traditions.\r\n\r\nLogin and check out www.RenaissanceWeekend.org/upcoming-weekends for other information. Please read the attached Guide to R/W thoroughly, which will explain the program formats, time constraints, roles & other matters and should address your questions. As the Weekend approaches, we will not be able to reply to all inquiries. Again, please read the Guide to R/W thoroughly. However, kindly notify us ASAP if your arrival date is delayed. \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your upholding the hallmarks of Renaissance:  \r\n* respect for the opinions of others\r\n* cordiality\r\n* non-partisanship\r\n* confidentiality\r\n* informality\r\n* flexibility\r\n* civility\r\n* taking relationships and issues\u2014but not ourselves\u2014seriously. \r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing you in Monterey!\r\nAli & Joy\r\nRenaissance Weekend\r\ninfo@renwkd.org | www.RenaissanceWeekend.org\r\nPost Office Box 22049, Charleston, \r\nSC 29413\r\n\n---\n\n| | ![](cid:image714874.jpg@8495D6FE.B720718C)| | | Renaissance Weekend| \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b  \n---|---  \n| [info@renwkd.org](mailto:info@renwkd.org)|  | | [www.RenaissanceWeekend.org](http://www.renaissanceweekend.org/)  \n---|---|---  \n| | Post Office Box 22049| , | Charleston| ,   \n| SC | 29413  \n---|---|---|---|---|---\n---\nContent-Type:\timage/jpeg; name=image714874.jpg\nContent-Transfer-Encoding:\tbase64\nContent-ID:\t<image714874.jpg@8495D6FE.B720718C>\nContent-Description:\timage714874.jpg\nContent-Disposition:\tinline; creation-date=\"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 17:04:21 +0000\";\n\t\tfilename=image714874.jpg;\n\t\tmodification-date=\"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 17:04:21 +0000\"; size=3640\n---\nContent-Type:\tapplication/pdf; name=\"Kreiman_Gabriel_269426_2025LABOR_Confirmation_ProgramAssignments.PDF\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding:\tbase64\nContent-Disposition:\tattachment; filename=\"Kreiman_Gabriel_269426_2025LABOR_Confirmation_ProgramAssignments.PDF\"\n---\nContent-Type:\tapplication/pdf; name=\"2025_Labor_Day_Renaissance_Weekend_Tentative_Program.pdf\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding:\tbase64\nContent-Disposition:\tattachment; filename=\"2025_Labor_Day_Renaissance_Weekend_Tentative_Program.pdf\"\n---\nContent-Type:\tapplication/pdf; name=\"Guide_to_Renaissance.pdf\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding:\tbase64\nContent-Disposition:\tattachment; filename=\"Guide_to_Renaissance.pdf\"\n\n\nMessage 2\nFrom: Gabriel Kreiman <gkreiman@gmail.com>\nTo: \n  - Mariela Zirlinger <mzirlinger@hotmail.com>\n  - Toby Kreiman <tobykreiman@gmail.com>\nTime: 2025-08-13T13:14:13-04:00\nSubject: Fwd: Labor Renaissance Weekend / Reply by 12pm EST on THURSDAY,\r\n August 14th\n\nInfo about the Renaissance weekend.\r\n\r\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\r\nFrom: Renaissance Weekend <info@renwkd.org>\r\nDate: Wed, Aug 13, 2025 at 1:04\u202fPM\r\nSubject: Labor Renaissance Weekend / Reply by 12pm EST on THURSDAY, August\r\n14th\r\nTo: <gabriel.kreiman@tch.harvard.edu>, <gkreiman@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n[...]\ninfo@renwkd.org  |  www.RenaissanceWeekend.org\r\n<http://www.renaissanceweekend.org/>\r\nPost Office Box 22049 ,  Charleston ,\r\nSC  29413\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nGabriel Kreiman\r\ngkreiman@gmail.com\r\nhttp://klab.tch.harvard.edu\r\n\n---\nInfo about the Renaissance weekend.  \n  \n\n\\---------- Forwarded message ---------  \nFrom: **Renaissance Weekend** <[info@renwkd.org](mailto:info@renwkd.org)>  \nDate: Wed, Aug 13, 2025 at 1:04 PM  \nSubject: Labor Renaissance Weekend / Reply by 12pm EST on THURSDAY, August 14th  \nTo: <[gabriel.kreiman@tch.harvard.edu](mailto:gabriel.kreiman@tch.harvard.edu)>, <[gkreiman@gmail.com](mailto:gkreiman@gmail.com)>  \n\n  \n  \n[...]\nLogin and check out [www.RenaissanceWeekend.org/upcoming-weekends](http://www.RenaissanceWeekend.org/upcoming-weekends) for other information.

These charges will then be evenly re-applied to your bills monthly from May through October. All interest charges for this deferral have been waived.  \nAdditionally, National Grid and the other Sponsors of Mass Save\u00ae have lowered the proposed costs within the three-year energy efficiency plan to help reduce the energy efficiency surcharge on your bill. We\u2019ll keep you updated on any rate adjustments as they are determined.  \nWe are committed to delivering safe and reliable natural gas to you and the communities we serve. We recognize that affordability is a significant concern, and we'll continue working with regulators, elected officials, and others on efforts to provide longer-term rate relief.   \nWe offer various programs and services to help you manage your energy bill, access financial assistance or request a payment plan if needed.   \n[Find Bill Assistance](https://click.emails.nationalgridus.com/?qs=7eae4c43ed12fe078c4a4bf943c62cd29277198a4e1c23c81d2697bb934ae32b342f8432fdfa6e31c262b8da454e41338e1b45d26080bdba2eac9645fcd1086c)  \n|  |  [ National Grid ](https://click.emails.nationalgridus.com/?qs=7eae4c43ed12fe072559ac4d9aca1ffd57e5da5826e60e9fbde83869abe3da0e50cd82b81bae85d1c876f32f9273db07df5d8fd1398b07dc757f6173b9f99ea6)  \n---  \n![Blue Brand Line](https://image.emails.nationalgridus.com/lib/fe4415707564067e771770/m/2/091e7812-18f7-4ef9-b8ca-d2db7009c10e.png) |  |  [ ![Twitter](https://image.emails.nationalgridus.com/lib/fe4415707564067e771770/m/1/1996b683-c5f5-4df3-adce-022f0ce45e3d.png) ](https://click.emails.nationalgridus.com/?qs=7eae4c43ed12fe077e6ab5357f95e49353feed8a07aa7c5f8703ad9c67025986669b2141a5318715810c4874e433a1b36736d33c71e6eaaa92e03a903cf20fcf) |  [ ![Facebook](https://image.emails.nationalgridus.com/lib/fe4415707564067e771770/m/1/3a1716fc-a048-426e-ae73-051672dad38f.png) ](https://click.emails.nationalgridus.com/?qs=7eae4c43ed12fe07337eb30298e436e2124e38b2e82ac44b0eef8d7d855ce990e5b6d31f05376a8c215db6dce2d551f58324c7611d6896bb77c2842af385fd38) |  [ ![Youtube](https://image.emails.nationalgridus.com/lib/fe4415707564067e771770/m/1/cadc6814-9b0b-41ea-8fdf-8d0e432fc88a.png) ](https://click.emails.nationalgridus.com/?qs=7eae4c43ed12fe075447c267093bf933b65cfd4f43d151bb5e6b2e4dc4e6e3e5b49ee2a1ecda3d2c41c6b57c406d1d0719dbc1a36733b37b7ceccc46550d96c5) |  [ ![Instagram](https://image.emails.nationalgridus.com/lib/fe4415707564067e771770/m/1/c2fdc525-0e7c-41df-903b-8176133d71b6.png) ](https://click.emails.nationalgridus.com/?qs=7eae4c43ed12fe07017229a3350690e98526ec20ac6f9abcc780e4cd42604a32329a0b4d0185205bc240b6574dc59acf971b992cd91923d99dc6b7f318ca11ff) |  [ ![LinkedIn](https://image.emails.nationalgridus.com/lib/fe4415707564067e771770/m/1/8cef4fec-726d-40de-8103-3af29b4c6a85.png) ](https://click.emails.nationalgridus.com/?qs=7eae4c43ed12fe075cfa1bf740c0d06d873f3008e7e57f6e969dee1eb97a9778a7e11774c4fc075074f52fc72de1c3d18b82d6202b066925bb92d1cd1b465743)  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n|  |  This email was sent to gkreiman@gmail.com   \n---  \n[Privacy Policy](https://click.emails.nationalgridus.com/?qs=7eae4c43ed12fe07905766221a40ec2b8b37c9817c11f38ad6c8859640840c06ae0cb035051177da14d48a1face1a70c0bb1a256d2b0baa38725dc4cfa240c22) | [Contact Us](https://click.emails.nationalgridus.com/?qs=7eae4c43ed12fe07a9ac86535b6a0b272b39e4f9c684c630a2659b51e2b1fbd595f792680f11ef836e1dcf225e87758efbc2ba8629b7a4d22ec117af6715eca0)  \nPlease do not reply to this email  \nas this email address is not monitored.  \n170 Data Drive, Waltham, MA 02451  \n(C)2025 National Grid.  \nCM10480 MA GAS (3/25)  \n[![gas safety](https://image.emails.nationalgridus.com/lib/fe4415707564067e771770/m/1/31e8849c-092e-4426-9144-c6bab74031dd.png)](https://click.emails.nationalgridus.com/?qs=7eae4c43ed12fe073f33eb5ebcb5864db0f08c585fc50a8c00b3bbee707c8c9f443f681dce6edd33c255efa310ef456fdc3129dba20fe93f371687c74c0247a6)  \n**This is an important notice.

This is the 13th consecutive year\r\nthat I participate as a cyclist and fundraiser for this noble cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jimmy Fund really does an extraordinary job and it is important that\r\nthis noble mission continues to be achieved every year to alleviate the\r\nsuffering of children afflicted with this terrible disease. A hundred per\r\ncent of the funds collected at the PMC bike ride go directly to support the\r\nJimmy Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am writing to ask you to consider a donation (there is no minimal amount\r\nper donor; any amount is of course welcome) but my personal minimum goal is\r\nto collect $6,000 prior to August 2.\r\n\r\nThe instructions to make a donation via the internet, are outlined below:\r\n\r\nThe link is:\r\n\r\nhttp://profile.pmc.org/FD0029\r\n\r\nNote that my name is just the identifier as these funds never come to me\r\ndirectly but to PMC.\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions to donate via credit card or venmo.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your support of this noble cause!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFernando Dangond\r\n\n---\n<http://profile.pmc.org/FD0029>\n[...]",

Last week, local Nonantum business owner John Mula sold his 386-394 Watertown Street property recently permitted for 3 floors, 10 units for $1.5 million to a California developer\u2014congrats, Mr. Mula. That day, the new developer secured a commitment for a $5+ million construction loan to build a three-story, 10-unit project. But just hours later, the developer marched into City Hall, claiming they needed a zoning change in the Nonantum Village center so they can get an extra floor, and a 30% density increase to make the project \u201cfinancially feasible.\u201d What they DIDN\u2019T do? Disclosure to city that the bank already agreed to lend them millions as the project was financially feasible. This isn\u2019t about feasibility\u2014it\u2019s about greed. Developers are gaming the system for extra profit, while Newton residents bear the cost of No parking, more traffic, and vanishing neighborhood character.  The city council previously voted to rezone certain villages to comply with the state MBTA community act and at the time, committed to the residents to preserve the remaining villages current zoning for those villages outside the state mandate.   Now, The City council is considering reneging on its commitment to the residents, and rezone a section of the Nonantum Village center  It\u2019s time to speak up! Demand accountability.

As a father of three young children in\r\nthe NPS, a business owner, and an active community volunteer, I\r\ncare deeply about our city\u2019s future. I believe that Newton can\r\ncontinue to thrive by focusing on strengthening our schools,\r\nmanaging city finances responsibly, supporting small businesses\r\nand ensuring that local voices are heard when changes are\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\nMy experience as an entrepreneur, the founder of a school and\r\nfather of young children, as well as my expertise in finance and\r\nsustainability positively differentiate me in this contested\r\nrace. I represent the voices of a broad and diverse group of\r\nsupporters who believe that I can add important depth to our City\r\nCouncil and a voice for common sense.\r\n\r\nI want to hear your feedback - please email me letting me know\r\nwhat matters most to you.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve read my story, and believe that I have what it takes to\r\nexecute on our vision for Newton, then please support my campaign\r\nby telling your friends, hosting a lawn sign, or emailing me with\r\nyour ideas.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nJohn Chaimanis\r\n\r\n\u200b\u200bjohnchaimanis.org\u200b (\r\nhttps://click.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm/25h2hoh326wwwka3/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam9obmNoYWltYW5pcy5vcmcvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1SU04mdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9V2FyZCUyMDMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWNvbGRfb3V0cmVhY2g=\r\n)\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200bchaimanisatlarge@gmail.com (\r\nhttps://click.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm/n2hohvhv3m00pwu6/bWFpbHRvOkNoYWltYW5pc0F0TGFyZ2VAZ21haWwuY29t\r\n)\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n-->REQUEST A LAWN SIGN (\r\nhttps://click.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm/08hwh9h2dvrr5wbl/aHR0cHM6Ly9qb2huY2hhaW1hbmlzLm9yZy9sYXduLXNpZ25zLWFyZS1pbi8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPVJTTiZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1XYXJkJTIwMyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Y29sZF9vdXRyZWFjaA==\r\n)\r\nREQUEST A LAWN SIGN (\r\nhttps://johnchaimanis.org/lawn-signs-are-in/?utm_source=cold_outreach&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=RSN&utm_content=Ward+3\r\n)-->DONATE to my campaign (\r\nhttps://click.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm/p8heh9h4zmoo0msq/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGF5cGFsLmNvbS9kb25hdGUvP2hvc3RlZF9idXR0b25faWQ9SDVSSk00TVFXMjdUVw==\r\n)\r\nDONATE to my campaign (\r\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=H5RJM4MQW27TW )\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\nA BIT MORE ABOUT ME\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nI have dedicated my career to using finance to create a positive\r\nimpact. Today, I run a clean energy investment firm that employs\r\na dozen people directly and scores more through our work. We have\r\ninvested over $500M in clean energy projects, and have produced\r\nenough clean energy to power 25,000 homes. Prior to my work in\r\nsustainability, and immediately after graduating with a finance\r\ndegree from Villanova, I served as a full time volunteer teacher\r\nat Nativity Prep in Boston, and subsequently I co-founded an\r\ninner-city school in Dorchester, where I ran the business and\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nI am a hard worker and strong believer in giving back. I\u2019m active\r\nin Newton as a youth sports coach, as a community organizer and\r\nas a volunteer in my church, the Sacred Heart Our Lady\u2019s\r\nCollaborative.\r\n\r\nI live in Auburndale, where my 3 young kids attend the NPS (Burr\r\nand Day), and it would be an honor to serve you as Councilor at\r\nLarge.\r\n\r\nYour vote and my common sense approach will ensure a strong\r\nNewton today and tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200b\r\n\r\n\u200bUnsubscribe (\r\nhttps://unsubscribe.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm\r\n) | Update your profile

for your support. As a father of three young children in the NPS, a business owner, and an active community volunteer, I care deeply about our city\u2019s future. I believe that Newton can continue to thrive by focusing on **strengthening our schools, managing city finances responsibly, supporting small businesses and ensuring that local voices are heard when changes are proposed.** |  My experience as an entrepreneur, the founder of a school and father of young children, as well as my expertise in finance and sustainability positively differentiate me in this contested race. I represent the voices of a broad and diverse group of supporters who believe that I can add important depth to our City Council and a voice for common sense.  I want to hear your feedback - please email me letting me know what matters most to you. If you\u2019ve read my story, and believe that I have what it takes to execute on our vision for Newton, then please support my campaign by telling your friends, hosting a lawn sign, or emailing me with your ideas. \u200b Thank you, John Chaimanis \u200b[\u200bjohnchaimanis.org\u200b](https://click.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm/25h2hoh326wwwka3/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuam9obmNoYWltYW5pcy5vcmcvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1SU04mdXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9V2FyZCUyMDMmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWNvbGRfb3V0cmVhY2g=)\u200b \u200b[chaimanisatlarge@gmail.com](https://click.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm/n2hohvhv3m00pwu6/bWFpbHRvOkNoYWltYW5pc0F0TGFyZ2VAZ21haWwuY29t)\u200b |  |  ![](https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/wpixjyE1Rr8DGcNDKuL4ej/ckedDMAgGo6MyFXitmZvDB)\u200b  \n---|---|---  \n[REQUEST A LAWN SIGN](https://click.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm/08hwh9h2dvrr5wbl/aHR0cHM6Ly9qb2huY2hhaW1hbmlzLm9yZy9sYXduLXNpZ25zLWFyZS1pbi8_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPVJTTiZ1dG1fY29udGVudD1XYXJkJTIwMyZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Y29sZF9vdXRyZWFjaA==)  \n---  \n[DONATE to my campaign](https://click.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm/p8heh9h4zmoo0msq/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGF5cGFsLmNvbS9kb25hdGUvP2hvc3RlZF9idXR0b25faWQ9SDVSSk00TVFXMjdUVw==)  \n---  \n## A BIT MORE ABOUT ME\n[...]\n\n![](https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/wpixjyE1Rr8DGcNDKuL4ej/sfPxjJYP9EMmVqXokrqbtZ)\u200b |  |  ![](https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/wpixjyE1Rr8DGcNDKuL4ej/qvAuG9AMZWd54Je4X8WFBV)\u200b |  |  ![](https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/wpixjyE1Rr8DGcNDKuL4ej/j6Bc4PHfequp1ohgzsQSjn)\u200b  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n\u200b[Unsubscribe](https://unsubscribe.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm) | [Update your profile](https://preferences.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm) | 17 West Pine Street, Auburndale, MA 02466  \n---  \n[![facebook](https://functions-js.convertkit.com/icons?icon=facebook&foreground=ffffff&background=3b5998&shape=square&v=3)\u200b](https://click.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm/qvh8h7hdrzpp5kbl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL3Blb3BsZS9Kb2huLUNoYWltYW5pcy1DaXR5LUNvdW5jaWwtV2FyZC00LUF0LUxhcmdlLzYxNTc5MjExMjc5Mzk1Lw==) \u200b  \n---  \n[![Built with Kit](https://cdn.convertkit.com/assets/images/kit-badge-light.png)](https://click.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm/3ohphkh370gglwbr/aHR0cHM6Ly9idWlsdHdpdGgua2l0LmNvbT91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249cG93ZXJlZGJ5JnV0bV9jb250ZW50PWVtYWlsJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1keW5hbWlj)  \n![](https://open.kit-mail1.com/27u4lrdm0ocoh83d6mrt3hgqnd444hgh8k4nm)",
